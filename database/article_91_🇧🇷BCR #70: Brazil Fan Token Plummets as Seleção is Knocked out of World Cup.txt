üèÜWorld Cup Fan Token Watch üìâ

The jury remains out when it comes to fan tokens being a thing or not. ARG, the only such token representing a team still in the tournament (Argentina), is up 16% over the last seven days, but everything else is down only as Brazil and Portugal were both eliminated in quarterfinal play.

BFT, the fan token representing the Brazilian National Team, plummeted 60% as Croatia scored a painful tying goal in the last minute of overtime and then defeated Brazil on penalty kicks, and then fell further in the days following the match.

The bright side is if you‚Äôre bullish on the Sele√ß√£o in 2026 then now might be a good time to scoop these up at a nice discount üí©

You can track my fan token portfolio on CoinMarketCap here.

All of the world‚Äôs assets will be digital in ten years‚Äô time, Hashdex CEO Marcelo Sampaio proclaimed at an event hosted by Ita√∫ Unibanco, arguing that it is incomparably cheaper to create an asset in ‚Äútokenized‚Äù format than via traditional means.

‚ÄúIt's something revolutionary that can solve any problem that needs critical mass. The world of decentralized finance is very vibrant and it is one of the disruptive waves that it is difficult for the status quo to fight against‚Äù. (Valor)

Sampaio also argued that 2022 has been a banner year for digital asset development in Brazil and elsewhere despite the negative headlines. This is particularly true given the passage of PL 4401/2201 last month which creates a regulatory framework for crypto businesses in the country.

üèõ Public Policy, Regulation and Enforcement

The Chamber of Deputies released the final version of PL 4401/2021, which past in late November and now heads to the president‚Äôs desk for signature. The final version does not differ much from the approved text but does contain some additional mandates for the regulator chosen by the Executive Branch to oversee the industry, widely expected to be the Central Bank. (CriptoFacil)
Cassio Gusson of CoinTelegraph Brasil aggregated some helpful industry reaction to the PL‚Äôs passage.
The CVM, under its new head Jo√£o Pedro Nascimento, expects to share crypto regulatory duties with the Banco Central and that he‚Äôs been having conversations with the entity regarding how to divide the responsibilities. He also highlighted the need for asset segregation rules for crypto exchanges to better protect customers. Per Valor Investe, he stated at an event hosted by Ita√∫:

‚ÄúThe CVM will have an angle of action. I imagine that we will share functions with the Central Bank. The two houses will go hand in hand for the development of the cryptoeconomy.‚Äù
‚ÄúI see that there are a lot of crypto skeptics. As a regulator of the capital market, it is not up to likes or dislikes, but to bring discipline so that these products can be developed within values that adhere to constitutional principles, preventing crypto and some applications of tokenization from serving as a mechanism for currency evasion and financing of terrorism.‚Äù (InfoMoney)

However, crypto asset regulation was left off of the CVM‚Äôs formal agenda for 2023, Valor reports, as the PL still needs to be signed into law by President Jair Bolsonaro. Nascimento articulated that he intends to introduce more guidance in 2023 and that its priorities may change as the situation unfolds.

‚ÄúWe still have no way to place crypto assets now if the law has not yet been sanctioned. Our regulatory agenda may undergo modifications and the crypto theme will certainly see signposts this year,‚Äù

Daniel Coqueiri, CEO of Liqi, argued that the CVM‚Äôs approach to cryptocurrencies and tokenized securities is well-intentioned and well-informed in a CoinTelegraph Brasil op-ed.

CVM Superintendent Antonio Berwanger rejected the notion of ‚Äúconfidentiality‚Äù with regards to security token holders. Speaking at a BNDES Day event, he stated:
