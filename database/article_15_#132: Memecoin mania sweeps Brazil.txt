Nubank slashes crypto trading fees

Nubank is modifying its fee schedules to better compete with larger players in the crypto brokerage world.

The new rates will be calculated daily based on the customer’s buy/sell history over the prior 30 days and the amount of fees paid during that time. It previously charged 1.6% on all trades; that level will be reduced to as low as 0.8% depending on the individual’s transaction activity (the more activity, the lower the fees)

Nubank Cripto director Thomaz Lysakowski Fortes, CGA® explained that the move comes in response to customer feedback.

Federal Police indict 23 over Titanium Asset scheme

23 individuals involved with Sbaraini Administradora de Capitais were indicted for laundering millions of reais through the crypto asset manager Titanium Asset.
