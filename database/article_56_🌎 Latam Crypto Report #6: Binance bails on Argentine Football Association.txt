Binance axes Argentine Football Association sponsorship

Binance has ended a five-year partnership with the Argentine Football Association (AFA) early, claiming that the organization behind Argentina‚Äôs FIFA World Cup-winning soccer team breached its contractual obligations.

The exchange is terminating its contract with the AFA after just one year, CoinDesk reported, noting that Binance became the soccer association‚Äôs main sponsor in January 2022. Argentina then went on to win the FIFA World Cup in December 2022. CoinDesk also reported that fan token site Socios, whose previous sponsorship contract with the AFA was canceled, sued the organization shortly after it signed the deal with Binance.

As Binance said in a Spanish-language tweet:

‚ÄúWe regularly evaluate the results of our partnerships around the world and unfortunately, despite being offered time and opportunity, AFA has not fully met its contractual obligations, which goes against our business values and our association principles.‚Äù

In separate news, Binance recently made headlines for cutting employee benefits due to a fall in profits.

New LATAM blockchain LaChain launches

Argentina-based crypto platform Ripio announced the launch of a new, Latin America-focused blockchain at its recent Modular Summit in Buenos Aires.

Ripio will develop the new blockchain, dubbed LaChain, with other regional companies including Num Finance, SenseiNode, Buenbit and Cedalio (YC S23). LaChain is based on the Polygon Supernets service.

According to Ripio, the blockchain will be the first to totally focus on creating solutions for Latin America.

As the LaChain whitepaper explains:

‚ÄúLaChain is a blockchain that was designed to tackle the urgent economic problems that are common in Latin America. The platform is built to host use cases that are specially crafted to meet the particular difficulties that local businesses and individuals face.‚Äù

Bitfinex launches regional P2P crypto platform

Bitfinex has launched a new peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platform in Argentina, Colombia and Venezuela. This P2P platform enables users to buy and sell Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDt and EURt), Tether Gold (XAUt) and Ether (ETH). The company plans to launch a mobile version later this year.

Bitfinex CTO Paolo A. stated:

‚ÄúWe are delighted to announce the launch of Bitfinex P2P in Venezuela, Argentina, and Colombia. By offering a reliable and efficient platform for P2P token trading, we are empowering our customers to engage with the marketplace in a way that affords maximum convenience based on their needs and preferences.

The new platform comes after LocalBitcoins closed in February. LocalBitcoins counted Venezuela and Colombia as two of its biggest markets.

Argentina‚Äôs first bitcoin futures contract launches

Argentina‚Äôs first bitcoin futures contract has officially started trading, the Grupo Matba Rofex exchange announced in a July 13 circular.

Argentina‚Äôs National Securities Commission (CNV for its name in Spanish) approved the futures contract in April. The CNV said the futures contract will be based on Matba Rofex‚Äôs bitcoin index, which uses pricing information from different providers.
Only qualified investors will have access to the contract at this stage, the Matba Rofex circular stated.
CoinTelegraph reported that this is the first bitcoin futures contract available in Latin America. Brazilian regulators told CoinDesk in May 2022 that it had planned to launch bitcoin futures within six months on the country‚Äôs B3 stock exchange, but it appears that initiative is still on hold.
