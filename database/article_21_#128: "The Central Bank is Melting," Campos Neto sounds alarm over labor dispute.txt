🎙New podcasts

This week I chatted with Coinbase's Fabio Tonetto Plein, who heads up the exchange’s operations in the Americas outside of the USA. We discuss Coinbase’s product rollout and go-to-market strategy in Brazil. This episode is not to be missed, as Coinbase has the potential to massively shake up Brazil’s crypto scene if it executes correctly.

Lucas Gabriel Marins of InfoMoney also had a profile of Plein and Coinbase’s objective to offer users around the world a 5 percent yield on USDC stablecoin holdings.

“The Central Bank is Melting,” Campos Neto says after 48 hour employee strike

Central Bank President Roberto Campos Neto is sounding the alarm over employee dissatisfaction at his institution, which reached a high water mark last week after a 48 hour strike.

Disgruntled over low pay and the lack of a career plan, seven employees are reportedly leaving the bank per day for other opportunities in government and the private sector.

“The Central Bank is melting,” Campos Neto stated during the inauguration of Supreme Court minister Flavio Dino on February 23, highlighting the urgency of the situation.

The collective action now has support from 40 department heads throughout the bank, including Campos Neto.

Over the weekend, a group of high-profile private sector lawyers issued an open letter highlighting the importance of the Central Bank and calling for a resolution to the dispute. Signers of the letter include Bruno Balduccini, Bruno Meyerhof Salama, Camila Goldberg and others.

The Central Bank union recently rejected a proposal from the government to increase salaries by 13 percent by 2026. Instead, employees are asking for a 36 percent increase and career restructuring.

Last week’s strike delayed the release of an important economic forecast report.

The dispute also calls into question the timelines of two critical projects related to Brazil’s digital asset economy: the Drex pilot (expected to conclude in May) and VASP regulation (expected to be finalized in the second half of the year).

To make matters worse, employees at the CVM (Brazil's SEC) have followed suit and begun to suspend certain agency services in a push for better salaries.

The CVM’s employee union said in a statement:

“The growing dissatisfaction of the body's staff is motivated by the lack of responses from the federal government to the list of demands presented in September 2023, especially given the advances in negotiations for other federal public service careers, such as those that are part of the Central Bank of Brazil and the Tax Authorities.”
