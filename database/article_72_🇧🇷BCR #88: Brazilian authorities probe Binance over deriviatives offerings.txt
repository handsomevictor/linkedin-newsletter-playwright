Binance under investigation over derivatives offerings

Federal Police, the S√£o Paulo Public Ministry and the CVM - Brazil‚Äôs securities regulator - are expanding investigations into whether Binance illegally enabled Brazilian users to trade derivatives on its platform.

The investigation is looking into whether the world‚Äôs dominant exchange committed a crime by continuing to offer crypto derivatives to Brazilian customers even after the CVM issued a ‚Äústop order‚Äù, Valor reports.

Among the materials presented by the CVM include screenshots of interactions with Binance customer support in which a reporter from Portal do Bitcoin, posing as a trader, is instructed to change the language from Brazilian Portuguese to Portuguese from Portugal to circumvent the prohibition and access the product.

The CVM first initiated an action against Binance‚Äôs crypto derivatives offerings in 2020, which ultimately resulted in the stop order being issued as the exchange did not have the proper authorization to offer such products. There is a bit of background here that (Exame published a good piece laying out the background and history of this initial inquiry if you‚Äôre interested)

The agency then released an opinion in 2022 stating that Binance had sufficiently complied with the order.

However, the revelation of the support messages shortly thereafter prompted the CVM to review this position, and the matter has been under review by the CVM‚Äôs Market and Intermediary Relations superintendent since then.

Portal do Bitcoin reports that the CVM‚Äôs re-opened inquiry began almost one year ago and that the action ‚Äúcontinues at full speed through the corridors of the institution‚Äù. The report lays out the following timeline:

The CVM sent Binance an inquiry on June 1, 2022 requesting information about the types of products available to Brazilian users and the means by which users access those products.
Binance did not respond to the inquiry after two weeks, prompting the CVM to send a second notification and open a sanctioning process
The second inquiry was answered two months later by Pinheiro Neto, a leading law firm, representing both B Fintech and Binance
One week later, the law firm Galdino & Coelho Advogados sent a notification explaining that there was a private meeting between Binance and the CVM and that Binance was not aware of any sanctioning procedures underway

‚ÄúOn 08/18/2022, Mr. Daniel Mangabeira (Senior Director for Latin America at Binance), Dr. Gustavo Borba (in the capacity of Binance's consultant for this case) and this signatory, Dr. Pablo Cerdeira, with the best intention of contributing and collaborating with the relevant services developed by this Securities and Exchange Commission, demonstrating his good background, his good faith and his best spirit of collaboration. It was on that date, however, that Binance became aware of the present Sanctioning Process.‚Äù

On August 25, Mangabeira sent an email to the CVM requesting more time to respond to the inquiry - a request which was ultimately denied

The timeline becomes murkier after that due to partial availability of documents, including several being made confidential at Binance‚Äôs request. We do know that the CVM sent a notice to the Public Prosecutor‚Äôs Office of S√£o Paulo state in late 2022 stating that there existed ‚Äúevidence of the commission of crimes subject to public criminal action‚Äù.

The last substantive update available was from February 28, in which an internal CVM letter stated that Binance had submitted a Term of Commitment to be reviewed by the agency. If the document is agreed upon, it could likely require Binance to pay a fine and agree to change the way local investors access the products in question.

As part of the CVM‚Äôs inquiry, several employees of B Fintech were summoned to give testimony - with that evidence being forwarded to the Federal Public Ministry, Portal do Bitcoin reported.

Binance declined to comment to numerous local outlets that reached out, citing that it does not comment on ongoing investigations, it does not offer derivatives in Brazil and that it is committed to compliance and dialogue with authorities.

Cl√°udio Rabin of Portal do Bitcoin came on my podcast last week to discuss what his team of reporters has uncovered thus far. Highly recommend listening if you‚Äôre interested in learning more.

CVM agrees to discuss relief for fixed income token rules

The Brazilian securities regulator agreed to discuss easing restrictions for issuers of digital fixed income tokens following a series of meetings with industry participants.

The CVM issued an interpretation earlier this month stating that it views most of these fixed income tokens as securities - a characterization that the local industry took issue with.

Among the relief measures being discussed is a move to wave the requirement for a bookkeeper and centralized depository - services that the blockchain can perform instead.

Also, InfoMoney reports that industry participants are optimistic that the CVM will grant an exemption from the need to obtain a license to operate a crowdfunding platform.

Industry representatives argue that the CVM must clarify its position quickly. While the agency has not issued a stop order, tokenizers such as Liqi have frozen operations for the time being.

The agency is also open to loosening its crowdfunding requirements so that companies with more than R$15 million (US$8 million) in revenue can participate.

However, blockchain-based asset tokenizers argue that the technology is fundamentally incompatible with the crowdfunding regulatory framework. In particular, the current 120 day lock-up rule.

Liqi CEO Daniel Coquieri told CoinTelegraph Brasil:

‚ÄúIn crowdfunding there is a 120-day lock-up rule, when the issuer issues a token he has to wait 120 days to issue another token, this does not work in the tokenization market, which is very dynamic, there is a token every day, every week, the assets are originated much faster.‚Äù

Asset tokenizers are also hammering the home the point that many of these fixed income tokens don‚Äôt necessarily constitute securities. Rather, many of them represent a simple advance of funds which are to be paid back within a given period.

Vanessa Butalla, legal director at MB, told Valor:

‚ÄúIt is important to look at tokenization from the right perspective and not seek to fit into traditional structures that are already known. More than a new technology, it is a new business model, capable of offering access and liquidity with assets that were not available to the entire market and that are not securities or certificates of receivables. We are quite convinced of this.‚Äù
