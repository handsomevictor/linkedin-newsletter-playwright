Ola pessoal!

Welcome to üáßüá∑Brazil Crypto Report for the weeks of January 9-13 and January 16-20, 2023.

Apologies for being missing in action the last couple of weeks. I just wrapped up a wild couple of weeks in Davos for the World Economic Forum annual meeting and finally made my way back to Brazil.

Huge thanks to everyone who stopped by the Filecoin Sanctuary in Davos, which was produced by Filecoin Foundation in conjunction with CNBC. It was an incredible opportunity to showcase our work in decentralized data storage and open data services, which I reckon to be a critically important Web2 to Web3 transitional use case

Before you label me a Davos Man or WEF shill or whatever, please know that I‚Äôm fully aware that the WEF is a very controversial organization at this point in history, and I find many of these criticisms to be quite valid for many reasons. Given the state of humanity right now, the optics surrounding a secret cabal of billionaires and world leaders flying in on private jets to a remote town in the Swiss Alps to take orders from a James Bond villain-type character are pretty bad.

What the WEF does do better than anyone else is convene a super high-level community across geopolitics, business, tech, culture, media and philanthropy. These are people who are generally interested in sharing new ideas, understanding trends and getting ahead of the next big thing. Most of the people that descend upon the town aren‚Äôt even WEF members - of the estimated 12,000 - 15,000 people that show up, only about 3,000 are actual WEF attendees. The rest participate in side events, dinners, parties, other networking activities throughout the week, giving the town almost a Burning Man festival type vibe - especially now that there is an abundance of blockchain companies and crypto entrepreneurs plotted in venues across the city.

Simply put, there is no other event in the world that attracts the spectrum of high-level people in the same manner as Davos. The mix of people, events and energy around town is the insanely high quality year after year, which is why I make it a point to attend every year even though I am not a huge proponent of the WEF as an organization itself.

The Filecoin Foundation activation was a huge hit - we hosted an incredible fireside chat between Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the world wide web, and Filecoin founder Juan Benet. It was a moment that brought together two generations of internet pioneers on one of the world‚Äôs biggest stages. Truly incredible to witness.

Greta Thunberg also made a surprise appearance at our venue to bash Davos elites for not caring enough about climate change.

I also had the chance to host a Latin America crypto adoption panel discussion at another venue with Taynaah Reis of Moeda Seeds, Andre Portilho of BTG Pactual and Justus Schreiner of Casper Labs.

In between all of the madness, I was able to sneak in a couple of ski outings in frigid temperatures. Unfortunately, I had to quit early as my goggles kept fogging up and then freezing - rendering them unusable.

I realize I‚Äôve fallen a bit behind on keeping up my weekly cadence and delivering on some other projects, so please bear with me as I try to make up for lost time here.

Anyways, with this WEF project behind me I plan to invest more time and resources into growing the Brazil Crypto Report footprint over the rest of 2023.

As always, I appreciate you reading and I hope you have a great week.

Braiscompany delays payouts to investors again as another crypto pyramid scheme borders on collapse

The case of Para√≠ba-based Braiscompany, which offers ‚Äúcrypto-asset rental‚Äù services to clients with the promise of enticing yields, grows more gloomy by the day. The firm, which claims to be the largest blockchain holding company in Latin America, delayed payments to investors for the third consecutive month, raising alarms about its solvency and prompting a flurry of complaints on social media and elsewhere.

Braiscompany offers a fairly straight-forward scheme whereby clients lock up a certain amount of bitcoin for a fixed period and then receive payouts each month (anywhere from 7% - 15%) tied to the gains created by the company‚Äôs traders.

The firm began delaying payouts to its ~10,000 investors in late December, prompting a myriad of complaints from clients on Reclame Aqui and Instagram (where the firm had to deactivate comments on its posts) and elsewhere demanding their money back. Many have gone so far as to camp out outside Braiscompany‚Äôs headquarters in Campina Grande until they are paid what they reckon they are owed.

Some are suggesting that a Braiscompany collapse will have the same injurious impact on Brazilian investors in the same manner as other infamous crypto pyramid schemes like GAS Consultoria, Atlas Quantum and Rental Coins.

Braiscompany owner Antonio Ais Neto emphasized that his company has one million customers and only small portion - just one percent - are having issues withdrawing funds.

Other reports have emerged asserting that the firm‚Äôs R$40,000 office rent has not been paid since last September.

In response to complaints, the Neto Ais pointed the finger at FTX and Binance in order to deflect criticism, specifically accusing Binance of arbitrarily locking Braiscompany‚Äôs withdrawals. Roughly 80% of the company‚Äôs trades are done through Binance and 80% of the firm‚Äôs capital is held on the exchange.

Braiscompany then required that customers submit a declaration of wealth, detailing how much money they have and how they acquired it - in addition to income tax returns, in order for their funds to be returned. Braiscompany stated in an email to clients informing them of these requirements:

‚ÄúExchanges are entitled to demand certain proofs of legitimacy from their customers. We received a request to clarify reports from some customers selected by the exchange to demonstrate some information. These are routine data, as soon as these reports are satisfactory, all resources will be released‚Äù

A complaint was registered with the CVM, Brazil‚Äôs securities authority, on January 12 accusing Braiscompany of undertaking an irregular securities offering and requesting an investigation. Both the CVM and Paraiba‚Äôs Public Ministry have been investigating the firm since at least July 2022.

Anbima, a capital markets trade group, emphasized that it has not endorsed or approved Braiscompany and that the company has been misusing the Anbima brand in promoting itself.

YouTuber and Suno Research founder Tiago Reis has also been warning of the company‚Äôs insolvency for several weeks and urging investors to get out while they can. He wrote in a complaint on his Instagram profile:

‚ÄúIn the beginning, Braiscompany offered more returns, and now it is decreasing. A sign that the pyramid is losing strength. If you have money or have a friend there, withdraw your money and let them know.‚Äù

Record News‚Äô Batalha dos Startups reality television program has also expelled Braiscompany from its show until the case is clarified.

Portal do Bitcoin has been doing some excellent reporting on this so I‚Äôd encourage you to check it out.

Brazil‚Äôs Digital Real will function as a wholesale CBDC used for large transactions by banks and financial institutions. Digital Real-backed stablecoins, essentially tokenized versions of the Digital Real issued by banks, will be used by the retail population, Fabio Araujo explained this week to Valor.
The key difference between this approach and that taken by countries like China, which is developing its own digital yuan, is that instead of simply tokenizing cash Brazil is turning bank deposits into Digital Real tokens. The advantage of this approach, according to Araujo, is that it creates a focus on building a tokenized economy and leaves retail distribution to existing intermediaries. Araujo stated:

‚ÄúWe thought it better to eliminate this risk from the system and reproduce what already existed. The intention was to bring technology, provide new services, reduce costs and democratize access, but without changing the current operational and regulatory structure‚Äù

Araujo also revealed that the Banco Central is developing its own Ethereum-inspired blockchain for the Digital Real, with the goal of migrating the current Brazilian payments system to the digital economy. Araujo told Valor:

‚ÄúWe need to make the Digital Payment System, which will be the platform for the digital real, and which will operate in an integrated way with what already exists.‚Äù (CoinTelegraph Brasil)
