São Paulo FC Acquires Argentine Footballer with Crypto

In the most expensive deal in club history, SPFC acquired Argentine midfielder Giuliano Gallopo from Club Atlético Banfield for US$6m, and signed the 23 year old to a five year contract. The transaction was paid in USDC stablecoins and facilitated by Bitso. Bitso Brasil CEO Thales Freitas stated:

“This is a historic moment for Bitso, São Paulo and South American football. Our main mission with SPFC is to contribute to greater modernization, digitalization and inclusion in Brazilian sport, and this is another important step in this direction. We are very proud to work with both clubs to make hiring possible with all the security, transparency and flexibility that the cryptoeconomy offers.”
🎉Nubank Reaches 1 million crypto customers

Nubank has eclipsed 1 million crypto customers just three weeks after making trading available to customers, making it the second-largest crypto trading platform in Brazil. Crypto purchases can be made within the Nubank app, via a partnership with Paxos, without restriction during the day and throughout the week, with a minimum purchase of R$1.

CEO David Velez commented that he’s “super impressed with the speed” at which the number was reached (one million was the goal for the first year!). Nubank had 46.5 million total active users at the end of the first quarter 2022.

NuCripto currently offers just bitcoin and ether and is hoping to add new assets soon and expand into other areas like tokenization. Vélez told NeoFeed:

“It's an easy investment experience, but we want to avoid speculation“That's why we've been creating educational content…It is proof of our great cross selling potential for our customer base.”

Nubank’s crypto lead Thomas Fortes said in a statement:

“This extraordinary achievement of 1 million customers in the crypto world in such a short time shows that we are on the right track, well positioned and in line with our purpose of democratizing cryptocurrencies and providing customer access to new financial opportunities.”
“The disruptive potential of the technology behind cryptocurrencies is enormous. We will continue to evolve this experience, always listening to our customers to seek to evolve our products and digital currency offering, taking advantage of this transformative power of blockchain.”
BTG Pactual, Santander Move Ahead with Crypto Products

Two of Brazil’s largest banks took big steps this week in rolling out crypto products for customers. BTG Pactual, the largest investment bank in Latin America, went live with its crypto trading platform - Mynt. Looking to keep pace with rival XP, it now officially throws itself into the scramble to reach the Brazilian retail investor, after opening the waitlist last fall. Andre Portilho, head of digital assets at BTG Pactual, commented:

“Our goal is to offer access to investments in crypto assets in a simple, direct and secure way. In addition, we will have content for people to know how to invest in new financial market scenarios."

Spanish multinational bank Santander plans to soon offer crypto trading to its clients in Brazil. Santander Brasil CEO Mario Leao stated:

“We recognize that it is a market that is here to stay, and it is not necessarily a reaction to competitors positioning themselves. It is simply a vision that our client has demand for this type of asset, so we have to find the most correct and most educational way to do it.”
