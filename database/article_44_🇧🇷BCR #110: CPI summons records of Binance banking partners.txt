I had the chance to attend and speak at the CryptoMinds conference in S√£o Paulo this weekend, where I got to learn a ton about trading mechanics and reconnect with some old friends like Tone Vays and Rodrigo D. Ambrissi (aka Rodrix Digital). I delivered my first-ever Portuguese language main stage talk, which was a bit of a challenge but got some great feedback from attendees!

I had the chance to catch up with Robert and his team during a recent visit to S√£o Paulo to learn more about the company and how they are approaching Brazil - definitely worth a watch/listen!

CPI breaks bank secrecy for Binance fiat partners

The special congressional committee, devoted to examining cryptocurrency pyramid schemes, approved a request to summon the banking, tax and data records of Capitual, LatamGateway , Aceso and Banco BS2. 

All of these entities have had banking or payment processing relationships with Binance in the past. The requests come just a week after Binance Brasil director general Guilherme Haddad Nazar testified in front of the committee about the exchange‚Äôs operations in the country and connections to alleged crypto pyramids. 

The committee also approved requests for the Central Bank to provide information on Binance‚Äôs proposed acquisition of the @Sim;Paul Investimentos brokerage, and for the CVM to provide details on its ongoing investigations into Binance.

Unrelated, the CPI will unseal financial records for Braiscompany and Trust Investing, two high profile pyramid schemes being examined by the committee.

Congress explores blockchain for public sector

The Chamber of Deputies held a hearing exploring the use of blockchain technology as a way to combat corruption and improve efficiencies in the public sector. 

Diego Oliveira Farias, external control auditor at the Federal Court of Auditors (TCU), explained that his agency is already looking to implement a version of the tech: 

‚ÄúA model that allows the manager to see if he needs to use it in his administration, and this prevents him from using it as a fad, so that there is no waste of public money. In the fight against corruption, it allows data traceability and reduces the need for complex processes.‚Äù (Portal do Bitcoin)

Chic√£o Bulh√µes, secretary of Economic Development, Innovation and Simplification for Rio de Janeiro, said that blockchain can be a critical tool to reduce Brazil‚Äôs bloated bureaucracy of notaries:

‚ÄúThe certification function that blockchain brings is revolutionary for a country that is still the country of notary offices. The country needs to understand that this instrument is there, it is here to stay, and it is extremely safe, to the point where we can put a digital currency to work.‚Äù

However, there are concerns that there are incompatibilities between using a blockchain solution for public sector data and Brazil‚Äôs data protection laws. 

Other witnesses included Aristides Cavalcante Neto, deputy head of the Central Bank‚Äôs IT department, and Mercado Bitcoin head of government affairs Julien Machado Dutra. You can see the full video the hearing below.

Mercado Bitcoin listed USD Stablecolb (SCB), a dollar-paired stablecoin created by Brazilian Yulgan Lira (yulgan.eth) in Switzerland.

Lira told Valor: 

‚ÄúCurrently, Colb offers direct entry through international banking transactions, and being on the MB side expands access for a company that has already solved the entry and exit of funds with credibility in Brazil.‚Äù

 Fabr√≠cio Tota, head of new business at Mercado Bitcoin, said in a statement:

‚ÄúThe stablecoin game is not over. There is still room for a stablecoin that is fully compliant with regulation. This is why MB chose to list SCB. US dollar stablecoins continue to be the smartest way to expose yourself to the price of the US dollar.‚Äù (Portal do Bitcoin)

Doing nothing is sometimes better than doing something you don't know. When I have money and want to invest, I use bitcoin. I operate Ethereum to ‚Äòspin‚Äô resources to other projects. But bitcoin is my long-term financial reserve.‚Äù
