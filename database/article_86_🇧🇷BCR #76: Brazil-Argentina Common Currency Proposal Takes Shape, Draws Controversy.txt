Ola pessoal!

Welcome to üáßüá∑Brazil Crypto Report for the weeks of January 23-27, 2023. I snuck away for a few hours this weekend to check out the Flamengo vs Palmeiras match in Brasilia for the Brasil Supercopa.

It was my first ever Brazilian football match and a pretty incredible experience overall - though I naively thought that simply purchasing a ticket would guarantee me a seat. I quickly realized that‚Äôs not how it works in Latin America as there were two times as many people in my section as there were actual seats. In the end it didn‚Äôt matter if we had seats or not because everyone stood for the entire game anyways. Fun stuff! 

As always, I appreciate you reading and I hope you have a great week.

Brazil-Argentine common currency takes shape

The conversation over a potential South American currency continued to rage on Twitter this week after Lula and Argentine president Alberto Fernandez shared their intentions to push the project - called the ‚ÄúSur‚Äù. Ideally, the shared currency would increase trade between the two countries while reducing dependence on the dollar.

The text signed by both heads of state following their first bilateral meeting states reads:

‚ÄúWe also decided to advance discussions on a common South American currency that can be used for both financial and commercial flows, reducing operational costs and our external vulnerability,‚Äù

Finance Minister Fernando Haddad articulated that Brazil would have two official currencies in this scenario - the Real and the CBDC shared by the two nations. Haddad explained that he has been discussing the topic with his counterpart, Sergio Massa - Argentina‚Äôs Minister of Economy, but there are no further details on how it would work.

The project has its share of naysayers. Brazilian Central Bank President Roberto Campos Neto stated that he is against the idea, stating during a webinar:

"I am against. I don't think it makes sense for us right now for a variety of reasons.‚Äù

Joao Zecchin, founding partner at Fuse Capital, argued that single currencies shared by countries with different monetary policies has proven to be problematic, but suggested that a blockchain-based synthetic currency used as an intermediary between the two countries could be feasible. He told Exame:

"It is a solution to have a middle way, without committing the two central banks to identical monetary policies but still facilitating the exchange rate. It could even use the infrastructure of Real Digital and a future Peso Digital and create an exchange rate with settlements blockchain, also avoiding SWIFT."

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong even chimed into the discussion by suggesting that the countries should consider adopting bitcoin as their single currency, similar to El Salvador.

2023 could be a lost year for crypto regulation amid transitions and political turmoil

Paulo Alves of InfoMoney wrote an important article highlighting how momentum behind crypto regulation could slow down significantly this year as political turmoil in Brasilia, transitional bureaucracy and other competing priorities may force it to take a back seat.

While the enabling legislation was signed into law in late December and has a deadline of 180 days to enter into effect, specific rules have yet to be defined nor has a formal regulatory body (expected to be the Central Bank) been designated by the Executive Branch. Further, there is nothing preventing this 180 day deadline from being extended.

This means that work on developing a consultation and rulemaking process for crypto exchange licenses may not begin for some time, rendering it unlikely that any such licenses will be issued this year.

Others interviewed for the piece expressed concern that the new Lula government may opt not to designate the Central Bank as the industry regulator. Attorney Rodrigo Caldas de Carvalho Borges argued that such an outcome would render the law toothless. He told InfoMoney:

‚ÄúNot defining [the BC] would empty the law‚Ä¶The benefit of appointing a technical body makes the process more dynamic than the legislative one, and this would be lost. The market would remain in a gray area and the law would have little effect‚Äù.
Parfin raises US$15 million in latest round

The crypto service provider for institutions raised from Framework Ventures, Valor Capital Group, Alexia Ventures and L4 Venture Builder - an investment fund formed by the B3 Exchange.

Parfin provides a variety of Web3 infrastructure solutions including MPC custody, an API that allows institutions to offer crypto to end users, treasury management, an OTC desk and a ‚Äúblockchain as a service‚Äù platform called Cryptum. The funds will be used to launch new products like Parchain, a permissioned EVM fork that enables DeFi and asset tokenization.

Jochen Mielke de Lima, CEO of B3 Digital Assets, commented:

‚ÄúParfin is an excellent partner with a solid team and technology stack‚Ä¶With this step and a new capital increase, we hope to further strengthen our relationship and we hope that Parfin will continue to execute its roadmap to offer digital infrastructure at an institutional level, reconciling market experience and technological innovation‚Äù

Parfin‚Äôs Cryptum product currently has approximately 300 clients in Brazil, according to CEO and founder Andre Salem.
