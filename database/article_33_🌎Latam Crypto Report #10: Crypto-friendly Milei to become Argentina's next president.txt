Crypto-friendly, libertarian Javier Milei to become Argentina’s next president

The crypto community is downright fascinated with Argentina’s incoming right-wing president Javier Milei, who surprised the country last weekend when he won a runoff election against Economy Minister Sergio Massa.

While Milei has expressed enthusiasm for crypto and radical ideas such as dollarizing the economy and eliminating the country’s central bank, it’s important to remember that we’re still waiting to see how these plans might unfold after he takes office on December 10. Furthermore, Milei has not shared any plans to make bitcoin legal tender.

While it’s tempting to compare Milei and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele because they both support bitcoin, one must remember that Argentina and tiny El Salvador are different countries. While Bukele was able to quickly push through reforms like making bitcoin legal tender in El Salvador in September 2021, Reuters points out that Milei’s coalition La Libertad Avanza has limited seats in Congress and would need to solidify key alliances before pushing through his reforms.

What we know for sure is that all eyes will be on Milei to see if he can tamp down inflation, which is running at 143% according to Reuters. Argentines are also keeping a close watch on the Argentine peso-U.S. dollar exchange rate, the Associated Press reported.

It’s also worth noting that an array of local news outlets including Clarín, Perfíl and Ámbito reported last year that Milei was sued for allegedly promoting a Ponzi scheme after he posted about CoinX on Instagram. English-speaking outlets including Decrypt and Protos also picked up the news.

Regardless of the challenges facing Milei, crypto-focused outlets have provided no shortage of takes in the past few days about how the industry is receiving the news and what his presidential tenure could mean for digital assets.

For example, Decrypt pointed out that while high-profile crypto figures are supporting Milei for his economic policies, the incoming president has also made controversial remarks regarding human rights.

The usually bullish Bitcoin Magazine discussed why the dollarization of Argentina’s economy would be one of the most anti-bitcoin measures Milei could enact.
Noelle Acheson argued in a CoinDesk op-ed that bitcoiners cheering on Milei’s election are “getting it all wrong.”

Credix secures $60 million credit facility for Latam expansion

The Solana-based decentralized credit marketplace Credix has raised $60 million to expand its focus on providing loans to farmers and small and medium-sized enterprises in Latin America, the company announced on November 14.

Credix said it had secured a “$60 million credit facility from a leading, $3 billion alternative asset manager.”
Credix added that the funding “aims to bring the firm’s assets under management to over $100 million.”

“Credix’s cutting-edge technology platform is now facilitating access to credit opportunities across Latin America for this multi-billion dollar credit fund,” Credix CEO Thomas Bohner stated. “This strategic collaboration empowers Credix to not only expand its operational footprint but also contribute to generating risk-adjusted returns while fostering a positive social impact.”

LABITCONF wraps up 11th edition in Buenos Aires

The 11th edition of the LABITCONF conference in Buenos Aires brought together crypto experts from around the region on November 10 and 11.

Technology, regulation, transparency and security were some main themes at this year’s conference, Ámbito reported, with economists, developers and entrepreneurs joining crypto experts. The local news outlet chatted with several attendees, including executives from blockchain-based streaming service Flixxo, Ripio Select and BingX.
Criptala co-founder Juan Becerra told Cointelegraph that regulatory stability “emerges as a fundamental pillar in the panorama of the crypto industry” and “plays a crucial role in formulating action plans and strategies for the future.”
OKX President Hong Fang highlighted security as a main priority for the Web3 company during a speech at the event. The crypto exchange also hopes to physically expand into Argentina, El Cronista reported.
One of the most widely-covered talks at LABITCONF was a panel featuring Argentine economic experts Diana Mondino, Alfredo Roisenzvit, Agustín Etchebarne and Fausto Spotorno, Infobae reported.
