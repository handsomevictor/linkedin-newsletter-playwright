Binance receives El Salvador licenses

Global exchange Binance received a pair of licenses to operate in El Salvador, the company announced on August 8.

Binance said El Salvador’s Central Reserve Bank granted the company both a “Bitcoin services provider” license and “the first non-provisional digital assets services provider license” in the country.
The licenses allow Binance to expand its products in El Salvador and focus on tailored offerings, Daniel Acosta, Binance General Manager for Colombia, Central America, and the Caribbean said.
Binance said it is the “first fully-licensed” crypto exchange in El Salvador. In April, Bitfinex received what it described as “El Salvador’s first-ever digital assets license” issued under the country’s new digital asset issuance law.
Binance said it now has registrations in 18 markets globally. The company was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in June, and made a deal with the regulator later that month to keep customer assets in the country until the lawsuit is resolved.

Binance’s Latin America head Min Lin said:

“This announcement comes after many months of dedication from our team to provide all information and proceed with the necessary due diligence required by the agencies, showcasing our commitment to the Salvadoran market and our users.”

Argentina investigates Worldcoin

Argentina’s Agency for Access to Public Information (AAIP) has started investigating Worldcoin, the project from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman offering people crypto in exchange for scanning their eyeballs.

The agency said it is investigating how Worldcoin treats personal data in Argentina, with the aim of verifying its security measures within the context of laws protecting personal information.
“The investigation will carefully analyze the processes and practices in relation to the collection, storage and use of personal data,” the AAIP noted in Spanish, adding that “appropriate steps will be taken to address any identified issues and ensure that the company complies with security and privacy standards.”
Worldcoin told CoinDesk that the project is compliant with personal data laws in Argentina and other areas where it is available. However, Argentina is not the first government to scrutinize Worldcoin. Kenya’s government recently suspended its operations, and some European regulators are also looking into the project.
AAIP said entities collecting personal data must register with the agency, among other things.
The AAIP said the case has been gaining attention in recent weeks, as people around the country have been getting their faces and eyeballs scanned “in exchange for financial compensation.” This has happened in the city of Buenos Aires and its surrounding province, plus the provinces of Córdoba, Mendoza and Río Negro.
