OKX Lands in Argentina

Crypto exchange OKX announced the launch of its platform and Web3 wallet in Argentina earlier this month.

OKX, which reports having more than 50 million users worldwide, said it will offer Argentines its crypto exchange, OKX P2P peer-to-peer platform, and non-custodial Web3 wallet for NFTs and DApps.
The exchange “customized an intuitive Argentina-localized trading platform spanning popular crypto assets with deep liquidity,” OKX Argentina Country Manager Alejandro E. stated in an announcement.
OKX, which launched in Brazil last November, calls the Argentina expansion “a vital step in unlocking the potential of crypto across Latin America.”
The exchange will join several others already operating in Argentina, including Binance, Bitso, @Ripio and Lemon Cash.

“The immense promise of crypto and blockchain is expanding across Latin America, and Argentina represents a crucial launch pad for our regional growth strategy." — OKX President @Hong Fang

Honduras Bans Banks from Crypto Trading

In stark contrast to neighboring El Salvador, the Central American country of Honduras has banned its financial institutions from operating with cryptocurrencies.

Honduras’ financial regulator (CNBS) issued a February 9 circular, which prohibits institutions under its purview “from maintaining, investing, intermediating or operating with cryptocurrencies, crypto assets, virtual currencies, tokens or any other similar virtual asset.”
Institutions cannot allow customers to use these platforms to carry out crypto operations and must warn customers of the possible risks of using cryptocurrencies through their financial education programs, the document explains.
The financial watchdog notes that these currencies have not been issued or authorized by Honduras’ central bank. It argues that because Honduras does not have any specific legislation about crypto or virtual assets, consumers are “exposed to fraud, operational and legal risks due to their use, including that their acceptance could cease at any time since people are not legally obliged to transact or recognize them as a means of payment.”
This isn’t the ideal news heading into this year’s ETHLatam conference, hosted in Honduras on March 13-14
