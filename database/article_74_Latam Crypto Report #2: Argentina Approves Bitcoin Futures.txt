Latam Crypto Report #2: Argentina Approves Bitcoin Futures
Also: Binance launches fiat onramp in Argentina; El Salvador awards first digital asset license; Mercado Libre expands in Chile

¬°Hola a todos! üëã

Welcome to the second edition of the Latin America Crypto Report!

Thanks for joining us again for another newsletter full of the biggest crypto news we‚Äôve seen in the region over the past few weeks.

Just to recap, I‚Äôm Kristin Majcher, a freelance journalist from the U.S. who has been based in Latin America for the past few years. Please follow me on Twitter and LinkedIn if you‚Äôd like, and feel free to drop me a line whenever you see crypto news in the region worth covering.

For those of you just catching up, this newsletter serves as a sister publication to Aaron‚Äôs Brazil Crypto Report and seeks to aggregate and analyze key crypto developments playing out in Latin America. This publication is built upon the thesis that Latin America is a massively overlooked center for crypto adoption that deserves more attention.

This week there‚Äôs no shortage of those developments ‚Äî after a relatively slow news cycle kicking off 2023, crypto news in Latin America seems to be picking up. This week we‚Äôll dive into regulatory updates in El Salvador and Argentina, expansion news from Mercado Libre and Binance and how a reported restructuring of Venezuela‚Äôs crypto superintendency appears to be playing out.

So, grab a coffee, mate or your drink of choice and join us for a rundown of the most important crypto happenings in the region.

El Salvador Grants Bitfinex Securities a Digital Asset License

After more than a year-long wait, El Salvador has granted Bitfinex Securities a digital asset license to issue tokenized assets through its exchange based in the Central American country.

The license has long been seen as a key step in making El Salvador‚Äôs so-called bitcoin-backed ‚ÄúVolcano Bonds‚Äù a reality. The government had originally planned to launch the first bond last March but put the plan on hold, citing market conditions following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

El Salvador finalized a new digital asset framework law in January, which paved the way for Bitfinex to receive a digital asset service provider license there.

‚ÄúWe are delighted to be the first company to be awarded this license. It¬†will enable Bitfinex Securities to facilitate the issuance and secondary trading of assets with clearly defined rights and obligations as outlined in the new digital asset regulatory regime‚Äù, Bitfinex group CTO @Paolo Ardoino said.

Argentina Approves Bitcoin Futures

Argentina also saw some big regulatory news in its crypto sector this week, with its National Securities Commission (CNV for its name in Spanish) approving a bitcoin futures contract to trade on the Grupo Matba Rofex exchange that lists futures and options.

The CNV said the futures contract will be based on Matba Rofex‚Äôs bitcoin index, which uses pricing information from different providers. The agency achieved the approval through an innovation hub it launched a year ago, according to an official statement:

‚ÄúAs part of its strategic innovation agenda, the CNV authorized the regulation of futures contracts on the Matba Rofex Bitcoin Index, with negotiation and settlement in Argentine pesos and without delivery of the underlying asset.‚Äù

More than 2 million users have traded crypto on Mercado Pago in Brazil since launching in December 2021. The service is also available in Mexico

Mat√≠as Spagui, senior director of Mercado Pago in Chile, said in a statement:

‚ÄúEntering the crypto business is another step to continue transforming and expanding access to financial services in Chile and Latin America‚Ä¶Through this new service, we seek to give millions of Chileans access to the crypto world in an educational, secure and simple way, in order to generate greater financial inclusion.‚Äù (CoinDesk, BeInCrypto, Livecoins)

The CBDC would still have to go through several stages before becoming anywhere near ready for public use, including proof-of-concept, prototype, pilot and production stage. (CriptoFacil, CoinTelegraph)

As Peru‚Äôs CBDC presentation states:

‚ÄúThis research stage started with a stock-taking of the current payments system, which served to identify that low financial inclusion and lack of interoperability are the most important elements limiting the development of digital payments in Peru, and it is possible that a CBDC contributes significantly to solving these problems.‚Äù

Peruvian fintech @M√°ximo will launch a crypto card in the third quarter of 2023, its CEO Isabel Palao said in an article from Peruvian business media outlet Gesti√≥n. It will launch the card in partnership with MasterCard and Binance. (Gesti√≥n, BeInCrypto)

Venezuela

Venezuela‚Äôs crypto superintendency Sunacrip appears to be undergoing a major restructuring following the arrest of former crypto superintendent Joselit Ram√≠rez.

According to the Venezuelan news outlet √öltimas Noticias, Ram√≠rez was one of the public officials reportedly arrested by the country‚Äôs national anti-corruption police last month. He was reportedly removed from his post by President Nicolas Maduro himself, Decrypt pointed out, citing that local news outlet.

√öltimas Noticias said the authorities are ‚Äúinvestigating the disappearance of $3 billion from the sale of Venezuelan oil‚Äù that did not seem to officially make it onto government ledgers.

The government then published a decree on March 17 in an official gazette to restructure Sunacrip. That restructuring board is being led by Anabel Pereira Fern√°ndez, according to media reports in √öltimas Noticias and El Diario.
