IMF praises Brazil’s Digital Real initiative

The International Monetary Fund praised the Brazilian Central Bank and the Digital Real project in its annual Article IV consultation, which issued by the entity’s Executive Board. The report even devotes a full section to the topic:

“Directors commended the successful initiatives on the instant payment system Pix and Open Finance environment, as well as the plans for the Digital Real, while underscoring the importance of being mindful of potential financial stability risks related to digitalization.”

For context, the IMF Article IV Consultation is an annual assessment evaluating the economic and financial policies of its member countries that identifies potential risks and offers policy recommendations.

The report lauded the bank’s track record with prior innovations like Pix and Open Finance, while foreshadowing the Digital Real as the next big project on the roadmap.

“The next planned major innovation is the Digital Real, a wholesale CBDC. The goal of the CBDC is to provide a secure platform for the private sector to create innovative solutions using new technologies. End-users will only have indirect access to the Digital Real through regulated financial and payment institutions, mitigating the risk of financial disintermediation.”

The authors highlight the Digital Real’s novel design and note that it is quite unique among CBDC projects globally.

“Unlike other CBDC projects, the RD is conceived as a ‘smart’ platform that promotes innovation. In most countries, plans to introduce a CBDC pursue a combination of objectives, including promoting financial inclusion; making payment systems more competitive, resilient and cost-effective; and improve cross-border payments.”
“Over time, the new platform will require the digital representation of more real-world assets to enable a transition towards more token-based financial services. Such a transition would need to be gradual and supplemented with changes in the legal and regulatory environment, so tokens fulfil their functions reliably without jeopardizing consumer protection, financial stability, and market integrity.”

The report notes that the key policy goal of the initiative is to facilitate the migration to a tokenized world by “enabling a trading environment for a diverse set of tokenized assets”. This transition will require changes to Brazil’s legal framework to ensure a “bridge to reality”.

“some types of tokens need additional legal provisions to ensure that holders have an actual right over a real-world asset or service.”

The authors highlighted other risks related to the project including scaling challenges, funding risks, compliance with privacy laws and reputational and operational risks.

CPI on financial pyramids approves 156 witnesses; “Sheik of Bitcoins” pleads the fifth

The Parliamentary Committee of Investigation (CPI) focusing on cryptocurrency pyramids formally approved summons for 156 witnesses to testify before the committee. The witnesses include a mix of subpoenaed individuals, along with invited guests and experts.

Portal do Bitcoin reports that Federal Deputy Alfredo Gaspar has been under “intense pressure” to withdraw his summons of numerous individuals who have had a business relationship with Binance - including representatives from financial services firms like Capitual, Bankly, Latam Gateway, Banco BS2 and Méliuz. Gaspar stated:

“We have just approved hundreds of summons, there has not been a complaint of dissatisfaction. I got to know the lobby of these institutions in recent days and I find this request to withdraw from the agenda very strange, because it is a simple invitation to clarify the relationship with Binance.”
“Binance has used each of these companies, in different periods, to evade foreign exchange, with very strong suspicions of money laundering.”

Portal do Bitcoin has a full list of the approved summons here.

😒 In other CPI news, the much-anticipated testimony of “Sheik of Bitcoins” Francisley Valdevino da Silva on Thursday, August 3, proved to be a bust. The Sheik, mastermind of the R$4 billion Rental Coins pyramid, exercised his constitutional right and did not answer any questions after his opening statement (given via videoconference), in which he said none of his actions were illegal and criticized the Curitiba Public Ministry:

“It is not new that the excessive accusations of Curitiba's accusers undermine regular sectors of the economy.”

The session lasted just 17 minutes, and deputies on the committee were not amused. Deputy Gaspar said:

“I wanted to ask if he remained silent while robbing the Brazilian people of more than R$4 billion.”
