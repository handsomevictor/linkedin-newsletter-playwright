#114: Magalu launches crypto platform as XP and PicPay wind theirs down
Plus: With CPI concluded, what happens next? Ita√∫ and Liqi team up on tokenized receivables fund

Ol√° pessoal!

Welcome to üáßüá∑Brazil Crypto Report for the week of October 16-20, 2023! 

Bear markets in crypto are frequently full of one step forward, two steps back dynamics. This week was one of those for the Brazil market. We started off with some big news that Magalu had enabled crypto on its platform via a partnership with Mercado Bitcoin, only to learn that XP and PicPay (two other fintech giants) are winding down their crypto platforms just over a year after launching in response to low demand and regulatory uncertainty. 

If you‚Äôre still active in this ecosystem, you know well that crypto bear markets can feel like non-stop punches to the face. This past week was one of those weeks, but at least on the Brazil front things continue to trend in the right direction. 

As always, thanks for reading and have a great week!

Magalu launches crypto platform as XP and PicPay wind down

Magalu, the fintech arm of Magazine Luiza, has enabled crypto trading on its platform through a partnership with Mercado Bitcoin, which provides the underlying ‚Äúcrypto-as-a-service‚Äù technology for buying, selling and custody. Available coins include bitcoin, ether and USDC, with a minimum purchase of just R$1. 

The fintech is also exploring the creation of its own ‚ÄúLucoin‚Äù loyalty token, which will be offered to the 10 million+ users of its MagaluPay product. Fabio Murakami, product director at MagaluPay, explained: 

‚ÄúFor many of these clients, this will be their first contact with cryptoassets and the opportunity to start investing in digital currencies, starting at one real. We are going to show that transactions with cryptocurrencies are not a seven-headed beast.‚Äù 

Meanwhile, XP Investimentos, one of Brazil‚Äôs largest investment brokerages, is shutting down its Xtage crypto platform after the product failed to gain traction with XP‚Äôs existing customer base. 

Launched in August 2022, customers were able to trade bitcoin, ether, solana and a few other altcoins on the platform. Users will have until December 15 to sell or withdraw their assets without fee. 

It‚Äôs the second time XP has launched and then shuttered a crypto platform. In 2018 it opened a platform called XDEX, only to close that down in 2020. XP will continue to offer crypto ETF and other crypto fund products to its customers. It is unclear what will happen to the ~40 XP staff who have been working on Xtage. 

Fintech PicPay has also shuttered its crypto offering. Customers are no longer able to purchase cryptos on the platform, and will have until December 11 to liquidate their accounts without fees, or port them over to an account on Foxbit. 

The company cited uncertain regulations as the motivation for its decision to implement a ‚Äústrategic pause‚Äù on the product, indicating that it will consider re-launching when more clarity exists:

‚Äú[After] the company tested the market under current regulations, it decided to resume operations when there is more clarity on the topic.‚Äù

PicPay first launched its crypto product in August 2022, roughly the same time as XP, and claimed that the platform had been used by one million customers after just five months of operation.

Anderson Chamon, PicPay‚Äôs VP of products and tech, said in a statement:

‚ÄúNothing changes in relation to our belief in technology as infrastructure, and we remain available to work, together with the Central Bank, to boost and popularize this market in Brazil.‚Äù

CPI was ‚Äúbeginning of a new path‚Äù for Brazil‚Äôs crypto economy, says Ribeiro

Deputy Aureo Ribeiro, president of the CPI on financial pyramids, defended the committee‚Äôs work and recommendations in an interview with Portal do Bitcoin. He called it a critical step in cleaning up the local industry and stopping foreign companies from treating Brazil as an ‚Äúamusement park‚Äù:

‚ÄúWe were able to produce a robust report, delivered to the Federal Police, Federal Public Ministry and the competent bodies to continue the investigations. So I'm sure that the CPI was the beginning of a new path to be adopted with the cryptoeconomy in our country.‚Äù

Ribeiro added that the biggest difficulties were related to the lack of specific legislation dealing with pyramids, thus allowing them to operate with minimal consequence. 

He also brushed off criticisms that the CPI had been unfairly persecuting Binance:

‚ÄúWe are not worried about the opinion of A, B or C. Binance has problems, but it is not just in Brazil, it has problems in the world. Binance has explanations to give to the Brazilian authorities, it has to collect taxes in our country so that it can generate jobs, income, opportunities for people and fulfill its role for which it was designated here.‚Äù

Additionally, deputy and former public prosecutor Alfredo Gaspar told the Portal he was ‚Äúimpressed by the convincing power of the creators of financial pyramids‚Äù the committee interviewed over the course of three months. He was also quick to pile on Binance‚Äôs questionable mode of operating in Brazil, particular its use of so-called ‚Äúbus‚Äù accounts that combine all customer deposits into the same account without distinction: 

‚ÄúWe have some companies that have repeatedly shown non-compliance with Brazilian legislation. And they use some tricks to do so. Binance is one of them.‚Äù
What happens with the CPI recommendations?

Fl√°vio Dino, Minister of Justice and Public Security, received the report issued by the CPI on financial pyramids and indicated that he will follow the committee‚Äôs recommendations.

These recommendations include indictments against 45 individuals and the creation of four new laws. Dino stated:

‚ÄúWe saw here a very adequate and extensive list of crimes, one of them embezzlement, crimes against the national financial system, criminal association and money laundering.‚Äù

He explained that he will send the information to multiple authorities, including Federal Police, the National Consumer Secretariat (Senacon), the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (Cade) and the National Data Protection Authority (ANPD).

Meanwhile, Valor wrote in more detail about the four pieces of legislation proposed by the recently concluded CPI committee on financial pyramids. 

These bills seek to increase penalties on individuals who operate and promote cryptocurrency pyramid schemes, regulate airline frequent flyer programs, and create new rules for cryptocurrency brokers (mainly an asset segregation requirement and a prohibition on using ‚Äúbus‚Äù accounts to bundle customer transactions.

Daniel Mangabeira Dantas, Binance‚Äôs head of government relations for Latam, told Valor that the exchange supports asset segregation and the use of individual accounts rather than bus accounts, provided that these rules sufficiently protect individual customers. He also highlighted alternatives not suggested by the CPI, such as proof-of-reserves requirements, adding:

‚ÄúIt is necessary to look at this industry with the appropriate lens, and not as an extension of the traditional financial industry, at the risk of adopting ineffective mechanisms for the digital industry or strangling an entire ecosystem.‚Äù

Ita√∫ BBA Digital Assets, Liqi and Oliveira Trust launch tokenized receivables fund

Ita√∫, Liqi and Oliveira Trust have teamed up to create a tokenized receivables fund. The product, known as a Credit Rights Investments Fund (or TIDC, was developed with a fully tokenized architecture and represents the first publicly-revealed initiative of Ita√∫ Digital Assets since joining the Drex project. 

The TIDC was designed to be compatible with Drex CBDC ecosystem once it‚Äôs officially live. Its order of operations is as follows:

SB Cr√©dito originates the receivables and sends them to Oliveira Trust, which records and verifies ownership of the assets 
Liqi registers the assets as NFTs on the Gnosis blockchain and transfers to the SB Cr√©ditos portfolio
SB Cr√©ditos transfers the assets to the TIDC structured by Ita√∫. 
The acquisition of receivables for the fund is made using a stablecoin

Daniel Coquieri, CEO of Liqi Digital Assets, explained: 

‚ÄúEverything is on-chain. The TIDC changes the infrastructure of the capital market, because it is not like contracting with the same rules and procedures as a traditional FIDC and then tokenizing the share. It creates a new, more efficient and cheaper infrastructure, which connects with Drex as a tokenization chamber.‚Äù

Under current regulations, the product can only be offered to professional investors who have more than R$10 million in assets. Coqueiri hopes that a successful debut of this type of fund can help to make these investments more readily available to smaller investors.

üìà Markets

Bitcoin and cryptocurrency ETFs have generated the highest returns for Brazilian investors in 2023 compared to ETFs representing other asset classes, according to data from Monitor do Mercado. Specifically, the Hashdex bitcoin fund leads a ranking of 30 multimarket funds with a 51% return from January to September. Marcos de Vasconcellos, founder of Monitor do Mercado, wrote in a Folha de S√£o Paulo column: 

‚ÄúThe eyes don't see, but, interestingly, the pocket feels. The multimarket funds that gave the most returns in the first nine months of this year were precisely those that invest in cryptocurrencies. Those that left their shareholders feeling worse are also, for the most part, concentrated in a few types of assets, such as gold, silver and cannabis.‚Äù (Portal do Bitcoin)
