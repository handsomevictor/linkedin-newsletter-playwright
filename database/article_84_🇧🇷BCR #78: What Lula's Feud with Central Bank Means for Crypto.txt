Central Bank autonomy on the line as Lula lashes out at Campos Neto

Lula, Brazil’s new president, lashed out at the Banco Central do Brasil and its president Roberto Campos Neto this week in an attack on the institution’s autonomy. He argued that the bank’s 3.25 percent inflation target is too low:

“Is this country doing well? Is this country growing? Are people’s lives improving? No. So, I want to know what independence was good for….There is no reason for the interest rate to be at 13.75 per cent. Does Campos Neto want to achieve European inflation standards? We have to reach a Brazilian standard. An inflation rate of 4.5 per cent in Brazil, of 4 per cent, is a good thing if the economy is growing,”

Former president Jair Bolsonaro granted the institution official autonomy in 2021. Lula intends to review and possibly reverse this decision - re-positioning the bank as a political actor. According to the Financial Times:

Many fear that Lula’s administration is resembling that of former leftwing president Dilma Rousseff, who pressed the bank to adapt monetary policy to suit her political agenda and whose mismanagement of the economy was widely seen as a factor behind Brazil’s deepest ever recession between 2014 and 2016.

The comments sent jitters throughout the market as investors moved to reset inflation expectations.

What does any of this have to do with crypto?

First, Campos Neto and his team of technocrats at the Banco Central are supposed to be appointed as the official regulator of the crypto industry, pursuant to enabling legislation passed last December. Given the state of the relationship between the new president and the BC, it’s looking more unclear as to when this formal designation will actually happen
Second, Campos Neto’s team is the driving force behind the development of the Digital Real (not to mention other successful initiatives like Pix and Open Finance), which is currently being tested and expects to be rolled out fully next year.

In somewhat related news, the Lula administration is now picking a fight with Uber, the rideshare company, arguing that Uber drivers should be included in Brazil’s national social security system - effectively rendering them full-time employees. Luiz Marinho, Brazil’s new Minister of Labor, explained that if Uber were to leave Brazil instead of complying, he will direct the Post Office to create a similar ride-sharing application:

“What if Uber leaves [Brazil]? Uber problem. I'm not worried….I can call Correios, which is a logistics company, and say to create an application and replace [Uber].”
Brazil’s crypto market shrinks 24% in 2022

Brazilians reported R$154 billion (US$30 billion) in cryptocurrency transactions in 2022, down 24% year-over-year, according to data from the Receita Federal, Brazil’s tax authority. 2021, the peak of the crypto bull market, saw R$204 billion (US$39 billion) in reported transactions.

More than 62,000 CNPJs (unique businesses) performed crypto trades during December 2022. This is up from just ~10,000 in January 2022.

The figure is up more than 35% from November, which saw 45,000 CNPJs report crypto trades.
The number of CPFs (unique individuals) who transacted in December was down 22% - to 909,000 from 1.17 million (CoinTelegraph Brasil)

2023 will be a year of “cleanup” for the crypto assets industry as more serious players enter the space, Andre Portilho, BTG Pactual’s head of digital assets, argued in an interview with Reuters:

"Companies without a sustainable business model, that did stupid things, that didn't treat their customers well, that leveraged too much, those will fall by the wayside…Nothing that happened with crypto has not happened in other industries in the past ... Going forward, the trend is to clean up the industry, have more regulation and have more structured companies entering this market."

Arthur Mining, the US-based bitcoin miner run by Brazilians, raised a round of US$4.6 million to expand its green mining operations. It projects a 400% growth in its operation in the US, and it intends to launch a mining operation in Brazil, both of which should in theory allow the company to reach US$40 million in revenues for 2023. CEO Raymond Nasser explained:

“Closing a round of this size in the midst of one of the most challenging times in the market, with other companies in the sector undergoing judicial reorganization and bankruptcy, was a great milestone for Arthur. As ASICs have a high price correlation with Bitcoin, the moment to expand operations was as opportune as possible, being able to acquire the assets at a great discount, including part of the inventory of less efficient players in the market.” (InfoMoney) (CoinTelegraph Brasil) (Livecoins) (Forbes)
