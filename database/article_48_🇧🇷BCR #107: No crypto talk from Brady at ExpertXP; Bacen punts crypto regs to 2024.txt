üáßüá∑BCR #107: No crypto talk from Brady at ExpertXP; Bacen punts crypto regs to 2024
Plus: CVM rejects Binance settlement proposal; first interbank Drex transaction executed

Ol√° pessoal!

Welcome to üáßüá∑Brazil Crypto Report for August 28-Sept 1, 2023.

You probably saw that NFL football legend Tom Brady was a keynote speaker at the @ExpertXP 2023 conference in S√£o Paulo over the weekend. The event is advertised as one of the largest finance and investing conferences in the world.

Unfortunately for the crypto crowd, Brady didn‚Äôt address the elephant in the room issue, which was his association with failed crypto exchange FTX. Recall that Brady and his then wife Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen were ‚Äúambassadors‚Äù for the exchange run by Sam Bankman-Fried, who is currently in a New York prison.

My random/bizarre connection to all of this: Back in May 2021, when I was program director for CoinDesk's Consensus conference, I booked Brady and SBF to make their ambassadorship announcement at our event. It was months‚Äô worth of painful back and forth with their respective PR agencies, but at the time it was a huge win for me professionally and for the CoinDesk/Consensus brand. It was also a huge win for FTX, as the Brady deal was the catalyst that got a bunch of their other celebrity deals over the finish line (Stephen Curry, Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, Naomi Osaka, etc.)

In retrospect, the Brady deal was the ultimate top signal and sign that this industry had completely overheated. Fast forward two years: crypto markets are in the tank, FTX was revealed to be a pyramid, Tom and Gisele are divorced, SBF is in prison and Tom has lawsuits from aggrieved customers piling up but refuses to talk about the incident publicly (probably on the advice of his lawyers, but still). The good news here is that when you‚Äôre at rock bottom there‚Äôs nowhere to go but up!

On a separate note, BCR would like to pay our respects to Cl√°udio Goldberg Rabin, who is departing his post as editor of Portal do Bitcoin after six years. He‚Äôs contributed enormously to the growth of the Brazil ecosystem, never wavered in his commitment to hold the big players accountable and has been a supporter of BCR since Day 1. We wish him success on his next endeavors.

Thanks for reading and have a great week everyone!

Crypto regulation to come in 2024, per Central Bank

Otavio Damaso, a director of regulation at the Banco Central do Brasil , said that the institution would unveil its crypto regulatory and licensing framework in the first half of 2024, rather than the end of this year when many were expecting. He added that a public consultation should be opened before the end of 2023.

The comments came during Damaso‚Äôs testimony before the CPI committee on financial pyramids in Brazil‚Äôs Chamber of Deputies. He added that the framework the bank is preparing is in line with recommendations from the International Monetary Fund, Financial Stability Council and Financial Action Task Force.

Damaso also pushed for asset segregation in his testimony, urging Congress to act and give the bank the legal authority it needs to implement the rule.

‚ÄúTotal shielding would be very welcome in the legislation. We are studying how we can do it, naturally without the quality that would exist if it were in the legal framework, but how we can work some kind of segregation to prevent the entity's resources from mixing with the investor's resources. Will this give full security to the investor? No. The only thing that would provide full security would be the legal device [legislation].‚Äù

Hashdex enters the US bitcoin ETF race

I covered this a bit last week, but it‚Äôs significant enough to warrant a deeper look. Hashdex, in conjunction with New York Stock Exchange, came up with a clever maneuver that would convert its US bitcoin futures ETF into a mixed product consisting of spot bitcoin, bitcoin futures and cash.

The move offers a novel way of addressing the SEC‚Äôs concerns of price. manipulation in the bitcoin market. Instead of entering a surveillance sharing agreement like rival applicants have done, Hashdex will use the Chicago Mercantile Exchange‚Äôs bitcoin futures curve to derive the fund‚Äôs net asset value. It would also buy and sell physical bitcoin using the CME‚Äôs Exchange for Physical Transactions.

The key takeaway here being that these bitcoin transactions would be subject to CME‚Äôs market surveillance. The CME market has been approved by the SEC to be the pricing baseline for the four bitcoin futures ETFs currently operative in the US. If the SEC is comfortable with CME surveillance for bitcoin futures, it should presumably be comfortable using that same data to underpin this proposed fund.

Why is this important? Hashdex has a reasonable chance of sneaking ahead of Blackrock, Ark, Fidelity and Grayscale in race for a bitcoin ETF in the US.

The Hashdex team hosted a helpful Twitter space that went into what exactly they are trying to do and how it could succeed.

Ita√∫ and BTG execute first Drex transaction; questions surrounding

Ita√∫ Unibanco and BTG Pactual, two of Brazil‚Äôs largest banks, executed the first Drex (aka Digital Real) interbank transfer using Drex prototype tokens. Andre Portilho, head of digital assets at BTG, stated:

‚ÄúThe beauty of the network is that it doesn't need all the nodes to function. The nodes can now interact

Jos√© Augusto de A. Antunes Filho (Guto Antunes), head of Ita√∫ Digital Assets, added:

‚ÄúIt was the first exchange in the interbank layer of the digital real. It served to make basic operations more tangible.‚Äù

The success comes as six of the 14 consortia involved in the pilot have yet to successfully install their nodes on the Hyperledger Besu permissioned blockchain network. In particular, some consortia have found it difficult to meet the bandwidth requirements necessary to access the National Financial System Network (RSFN). The connection speed required by the bank for normal operations is 4 megabytes per second, versus 10 mbps required for Drex. A source inside on consortium told Valor:

‚ÄúHyperledger Besu is very simple, you can install everything in five minutes. The hard part is connecting to the RSFN with this minimum bandwidth requirement. Everyone is asking to increase the bandwidth.‚Äù

The bank told Valor in a statement:

‚ÄúSome participants did not have the required availability and, therefore, are in the process of resizing their access links to the RSFN‚Äù

These pain points, along with labor disputes at the Central Bank, prompted the bank to postpone from August 14 to November 3 the deadline for configuring nodes on the network and the start of tokenization tests from September 11 to December 4.

CVM Rejects Binance Settlement Proposal

The CVM rejected a settlement proposal from Binance and B Fintech that would end an investigation into the exchange‚Äôs alleged irregular offering of derivatives products to Brazilian customers. The exchange proposed a R$2 million payment, but ultimately the agency balked:

‚ÄúThe collegiate understood that the conclusion of the term of commitment would not be opportune and convenient, having decided to reject the proposal.‚Äù

In a note to press, Binance said:

‚ÄúAlthough it expected a different result, Binance reiterates its deep respect for the decision of the collegiate, and reinforces that it will continue to offer its services following the highest standards of conduct and in strict compliance with what the regulatory authorities determine.‚Äù

The CVM issued a stop order against Binance in 2020 for illegally offering derivatives in the country. Binance complied with the order, but the CVM recently re-opened the case after it was revealed that Binance was allowing Brazilian customers to access the products by switching the language on the interface from Brazilian Portuguese to Portuguese from Portugal.

CPI Updates

Former Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho finally appeared before the committee to testify about his role in an alleged crypto pyramid scheme called 18k Ronaldinho. His appearance came after he ghosted the committee three consecutive times, prompting CPI leadership to ask the courts to force him to testify. He forcefully denied his involvement in the scheme.

‚ÄúI was never a member of 18k Ronaldinho. The partners are Rafael Nunes and Marcelo Lara, who misused my name to create the corporate name of this company. I wanted them to be caught because they used my name, they tarnished my name. What I want most is for them to be caught so that I can clear my name. And if one day I can do something to help people who have been deceived, I will.‚Äù

Pacto Energia opened a small bitcoin mining facility in Cear√° as a way to use excess energy generated from a local hydroelectric plant. The technology was provided by Imagine Capital, which installed a container of mining hardware next to the facility under a revenue share contract. CEO Rodrigo Ferreira F. Pedroso said that his expectation is that mining bitcoin represents the equivalent of selling energy at a price of R$200 per megawatt hour, while the current electricity price floor in the open market is R$69 per MwH.

"We made lemonade out of that lemon and now there's a perfect storm going on. The price of bitcoin is rising, the price of energy on the free market is falling and there are machines available around the world after China banned bitcoin mining‚Ä¶"For us, it's better to mine bitcoin than to sell energy on the free market.‚Äù (Valor)
