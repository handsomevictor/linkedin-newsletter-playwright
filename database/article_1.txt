Welcome back to Brazil Crypto Report for the week of June 3-7. I hope everyone enjoyed their Festa Junina festivities this weekend.

The big news of this week is that the wait for regulations governing crypto brokerages will continue to drag out. The Central Bank of Brazil announced that the framework is now expected to be unveiled in early 2025, revising earlier expectations that they would drop during the second half of 2024 ‚Äî or at the end of 2024 at the very latest. The first quarter of 2025 is now the target range.

Renato Gomes, director of financial system organization and resolution at the bank, said that the institution continues to observe phenomena related to cryptocurrencies and stablecoins ‚Äúvery carefully.‚Äù

Specifically regarding stablecoins, he explained that the asset is a means to maintaining a dollar account in a cheap and efficient way.

‚ÄúThe person buys a stablecoin so that when he goes on an international trip he can sell the stablecoin, transforming it into dollars without going through the traditional financial system.‚Äù
