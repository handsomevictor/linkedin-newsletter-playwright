¬°Hola a todos! üëã

Welcome to another news-packed edition of the Latin America Crypto Report.

Thanks for joining us again for another newsletter full of the biggest crypto news we‚Äôve seen in Latin America over the past few weeks.

For those of you just joining us, I‚Äôm Kristin Majcher, a freelance journalist from the U.S. who has been based in Latin America for the past few years. Please follow me on Twitter and LinkedIn if you‚Äôd like, and let me know when you see crypto news in the region worth covering.

This week we‚Äôll deep dive into an announcement from Argentina‚Äôs central bank that appears to restrict fintech companies‚Äô ability to offer crypto, as well as how a new standards initiative from Mastercard might lead to new opportunities for U.S. - Latin America cross-border transactions.

Argentina‚Äôs central bank restricts crypto for fintechs

Almost exactly a year after prohibiting financial institutions from offering crypto services, Argentina‚Äôs central bank (BCRA) now appears to be keeping fintechs from offering crypto services as well.

On May 4, the central bank issued a statement saying that companies designated as payment service providers (PSPCP) are prohibited from offering services with unregulated currencies like digital assets.

BCRA says in its announcement:

‚ÄúPayment service providers that offer payment accounts (PSPCP) may not carry out or facilitate operations with digital assets, including crypto assets, that are not regulated by the competent national authority and authorized by the Central Bank of the Argentine Republic (BCRA). The regulation, therefore, prevents PSPCPs from carrying out these types of operations themselves or offering to initiate them from their applications or web platforms.‚Äù

This story is still developing, and we still have to see how this affects fintechs in practice. Nonprofit ONG Bitcoin Argentina responded in a Twitter thread, calling the measure ‚Äúsurprising and without consultation.‚Äù

Argentina‚Äôs fintech chamber also responded, saying it ‚Äúrejects‚Äù the regulatory change in its own thread.




The measure would apply to several fintech providers in the country, Bloomberg L√≠nea reported. These include: Ual√°, Bind Pagos, MercadoPago, Personal Pay, Mobbex, Nubi, Modo and Pomelo.
The BCRA said ‚Äúoffering or facilitating‚Äù refers to the ‚Äúavailability of automated purchase buttons for the user. Interested persons must carry out the operation on their own.‚Äù
The central bank said it aims to ‚Äúmitigate the risks‚Äù that digital asset operations could pose for people as well as the national payment system.
The news comes about a year after the Central Bank blocked financial institutions from letting their customers complete operations with digital assets.
The measure comes as Argentina‚Äôs annual inflation rate recently topped 104% ‚Äî one of the highest rates for any country worldwide.

Mastercard standards could help facilitate Latin America cross-border payments

A new program from Mastercard that seeks to provide a common set of standards for public blockchain networks could broaden the options for cross-border transactions between the U.S. and Latin America.

Mastercard says its so-called ‚ÄúCrypto Credential‚Äù will help bring standards across blockchain networks. According to Mastercard‚Äôs head of crypto Raj Dhamodharan:

‚ÄúMastercard Crypto Credential will establish a set of common standards and infrastructure that will help attest trusted interactions among consumers and businesses using blockchain networks.‚Äù

One of these use cases is cross-border payments from the U.S. to Latin America. Mastercard says that wallet providers Bit2Me, Lirium, Mercado Bitcoin and Uphold will collaborate on ‚Äúan initial project to enable transfers between the U.S. and Latin America and the Caribbean corridors.‚Äù
The card company said it will also be working with companies including Aptos Labs, Ava Labs, Polygon Labs and The Solana Foundation to implement the new standards, with use cases including NFT verification, ticketing and payment solutions for businesses.
The Crypto Credential will include aliases for sharing wallet addresses, metadata and the use of CipherTrace‚Äôs technology ‚Äúto help verify addresses and support Travel Rule compliance for cross border transactions.‚Äù

Walter Pimenta, Mastercard‚Äôs executive VP for product and engineering in the Latin America and Caribbean region, said in a press release:

‚ÄúLatin America and the Caribbean is among the top regions for digital assets adoption and remittances leveraging digital assets as means of value exchange. Mastercard Crypto Credential could help to address key challenges that have traditionally hindered mainstream usage of this type of use cases, driving more industry players to join this space in a meaningful way.‚Äù
