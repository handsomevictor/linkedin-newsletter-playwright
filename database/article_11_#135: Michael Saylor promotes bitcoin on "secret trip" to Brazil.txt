Michael Saylor makes secret visit; praises bitcoin adoption by Brazilian banks

Bitcoin evangelist extraordinaire Michael Saylor paid a visit to Faria Lima and Brazil‚Äôs bitcoin community last week, including a meeting with Central Bank president Roberto Campos Neto.

In his first ever trip to Brazil, he gave a private bitcoin lesson to Ita√∫ clients and participated in some other small events. He gave an interview to Valor‚Äôs Toni Sciarretta at the BLP Crypto office in which he lauded Brazilian banks for leaning into bitcoin:

'‚ÄúBrazil has been very innovative. The adoption of digital assets by Brazilian banks has been, I believe, one of the most enthusiastic and sophisticated in the world.‚Äù

At the Ita√∫ event, Saylor reinforced why he believes bitcoin is a unique digital property and an asset without parallel, both inside and outside of the world of cryptocurrencies, and a no-brainer investment:

‚ÄúI think Bitcoin has a clear path to multiplying its current value by 100. Because we now have certainty, and regulatory clarity, across the world on two fundamental issues. Bitcoin is a commodity, an asset without an issuer, and its use case is as property. And property is a store of value worth $100 trillion.‚Äù

He also fielded numerous questions from the audience about energy consumption, the bitcoin Layer 2 ecosystem and the volatile nature of the asset:

‚ÄúYou have to embrace volatility,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúSo most assets are either impaired capital or toxic or defective capital. Bitcoin is perfect capital, perfectly constructed. Volatility is an artifact of being an open, permissionless network that anyone can buy into.‚Äù

Saylor also emphasized that he sees lots of uncertainty still around non-bitcoin applications of blockchain tech, pointing to a likely SEC lawsuit against Uniswap. He went so far as to recommend that investors figure out ways to borrow money cheaply to buy more bitcoin as MicroStrategy has done the last several years.

Journalist Leonardo Rubinstein Cavalcanti of BlockTrends was onsite at the event (and obviously quite excited about it per his tweet below)

Ex-PayPal CEO Schulman joins Valor Capital

Former PayPal CEO Dan Schulman has joined Valor Capital Group as a managing partner based in Silicon Valley. Founding partner Scott Sobel said in a blog post:

Receita Federal to launch public consultation on crypto taxation

Brazil‚Äôs tax authority will open a public consultation this year to improve Normative Instruction 1888/2019, the rule by which the body captures information about Brazilians‚Äô cryptoasset transactions.

The RF is looking to update the rule to align with the Crypto Asset Reporting Framework, released by the OECD in 2022, that seeks to implement a ‚Äúnew model for exchanging information on crypto assets‚Äù across jurisdictions.

The agency‚Äôs 2023-2024 Annual Inspection Report, released April 5, stated:

‚ÄúBrazil will be one of the countries to be part of this cryptoasset exchange network, in addition to the financial information already exchanged multilaterally with other international bodies in the search for transparency.‚Äù

Transfero and Fuse Capital team up on BRX joint venture

BRX, the new venture, will find creative ways to deploy traditional finance concepts like credit and shares into the decentralized market, with the core objective of creating new blockchain projects and use cases.

Why are Transfero and Fuse teaming up for this project? Fuse Capital founding partner Joao Zecchin explained:

"It is only possible to make these products through the merger of two companies that operate in different worlds. Transfero is more native to the blockchain world, understands the potential of this infrastructure in operational efficiencies, and there is Fuse, which is a more traditional manager, with partners in the financial market, who understand traditional products."

The venture will begin with two of Fuse‚Äôs existing projects with a vision of branching into the Drex tokenization environment.

Transfero Group Ventures CEO Claudio Just explained:

"Drex will not be a stablecoin, it is more of a larger protocol, a layer, and the Transfero is on the top layer, needing to have a bridge between the two. BRZ [the company's stablecoin] seeks to provide liquidity to the Brazilian real outside the country and ended up becoming a specific token for tokenization. I believe in a co-existence.‚Äù
