Ola pessoal,

I always enjoy CoinDesk’s Consensus conference every year because it presents a snapshot of the entire crypto industry at a given point in time. This year was a bit frothy and overly shitcoiny at times, spiced with a bit of dread that we’re in for a rough patch (which is indeed playing out). But what I enjoyed most was the enthusiasm and breadth of the builders and the international vibe of the event - there were participants from more than 100 countries and you could feel the global vibe and excitement permeate throughout the festival.

I truly enjoyed the opportunity to meet crypto folks from the Latam region in person, and it was great to see Brazil-focused companies like Transfero, Parfin, Bitso, Mercado Bitcoin highlighted on the global stage.

Back to the Brazil front, we have extremely big news regarding Brazil’s crypto legislation that looks set to pass and be signed to law shortly.

Expedito Netto, a Federal Deputy and rapporteur for the bill in the Chamber of Deputies, rejected the Senate’s additions to the bill’s text. Most notably, he rejected added language that would have effectively blocked foreign exchanges like Binance from operating in Brazil. The clause stipulated that only exchanges domiciled in the country with the CNPJ at the time of the bill’s enactment would have been entitled to a 180 day period to adapt to the new rules spelled out in the legislation.

Netto struck that provision under the argument that the rules must be the same for companies that were not previously registered in the country. This means that both domestic and foreign exchanges will be subject to the same 180 day period to comply with the new law.

“There is no way to demand that,” Netto told Valor regarding the discrepancy. “The deadline has to be the same for everyone.” He added:

“It's better if I put less pressure on brokers, with a cleaner, simpler project that makes it very clear with transition rules so that everyone can participate, so that no one is harmed.”

A provision that would require companies to make suspicious transaction reports to the COAF (financial crimes agency) was removed from the text as well. Netto went so far as to say that

“COAF does not have the capacity today, as far as I know [to receive and analyze the reports that would be sent by brokers]“.

Netto said that the combination of the CNPJ registration provision and the COAF reporting requirements “prevents international companies from coming to Brazil at this time.” The Senate text stated that only companies that had the CNPJ and COAF documentation could use the 180 day window to comply with the other provisions in the law.

There appears to be evidence that Binance and other overseas exchanges succeeded in swaying Netto on this point. Readers of Brazil Crypto Report will know that the back and forth struggle between domestic and foreign exchanges in the legislative process thus far. Domestic exchanges have argued that Binance is skirting local rules and thereby able to offer lower costs to customers, which has therefore allowed Binance to secure dominant position in the Brazil market.

Netto also struck down a provision that requires asset segregation, which could prevent exchanges from offering more sophisticated products to clients. This rulemaking would therefore fall on the regulator assigned to oversee the crypto market.

He also rejected a provision that would remove taxes on the importation of crypto mining equipment, arguing that the tax issue requires its own standalone bill. He confirmed that the Banco Central would be the regulator appointed by the Executive Branch to oversee crypto markets, a move that markets had long assumed.

The bill stands to go to a vote possibly this week in the Chamber of Deputies. If approved, it would go to President Jair Bolsonaro to be signed into law. We’ll be watching this closely here and will have an update next week.

At the Valor Crypto Summit in Rio last week, Banco Central President Roberto Campos Neto gave an extensive talk on how his agency would regulate the space and also on the Digital Real rollout. Most importantly, he indicated that his agency would regulate crypto exchanges and brokers to ensure that customer purchases are, in fact, backed by verifiable crypto assets. He said at the summit, hosted by Valor Capital Group:

“People aren't buying crypto, they're buying certificates that supposedly have a crypto [asset] behind…The BC will regulate the exchange [of crypto assets] to ensure that whoever sells something has it.”

Campos Neto also shared that he believes systems that enable tokenization with verified ownership and value transfer are the true innovation of these technologies:

“What is at the center of the debate is not cryptocurrencies or CBDCs, but the tokenization of the economy. You add value and trade things in the form of tokens.”
