👋 bom dia friends,

Crazy week! Hope everyone is holding up okay. I have a lot to say about what’s gone on the last few days in crypto with regards to this Terra/UST situation, but in the spirit of civility (and because they are outside the scope of this newsletter) I’m going to keep those opinions to myself for now. TLDR is that if Michael Saylor starts selling his bitcoin, then I’ll start panicking.

🏦 The Banco Central do Brasil is in the crypto news cycle again as CZ and Binance representatives met with BCB President Roberto Campos Neto on Friday to discuss “institutional matters”. No other details about the meeting were offered.

Representing Binance was Changpeng “CZ” Zhao himself; Matt Shroder, VP of International Expansion and Daniel Mangabeira, who was recently hired by Binance away from Bitso and is becoming the face of the company in Brazil.

🔥 Not to be outdone, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong will be meeting with Campos Neto on Monday, May 16 as the firm looks to build out its presence in the country.

The meeting comes fresh off the announcement of its Coinbase Brasil entity. To kickoff, Coinbase held a live virtual recruiting event on Thursday, May 12 aimed at drawing in developers. I popped in for a little bit to see what the experience was like. It kicked off with a 10 minute bumper video (with Portuguese subtitles) talking about Coinbase’s mission and its belief in crypto, featuring CEO Brian Armstrong and other executives.

Former CTO Balaji Srinivasan was also featured heavily in the promo. Given that he left the company in May 2019, we can conclude that this video is at least 4 years old (might be time to update that!)

Three Brazilian Coinbase employees then discussed their experience working for the company, explained the interview process and then took questions from the audience about how to best prepare for the interview. I’m not a dev so it wasn’t really my jam, but attendee engagement seemed pretty good based on the questions being asked via Slido - seemed there were at least 50 who were actively participating.

The key point here, as InfoMoney’s Paulo Alves points out in a good column, is that new crypto brokers, whether they be foreign like Coinbase or domestic like Nubank, XP, BTG Pactual and now Itaú (who are all launching crypto offerings this summer), are not being deterred by the stranglehold that Binance and Mercado Bitcoin currently have on the Brazilian market. Will they regret launching retail-focused crypto investment products into what looks like the beginning of a bear market? We shall see…

🏔 Side note, I’ll be in Davos the week of May 22-26 for the World Economic Forum. If anyone is going to be around please ping me and we’ll meet up. Filecoin Foundation (my day job) is organizing a hosting a big event space in the church directly across the street from the WEF Congress Center. It’s a a big partnership with CNBC, CoinDesk, Global Blockchain Business Council and others. We’re open to the public all week during the day, and just ask that people register. Also hosting a big kickoff reception on Sunday evening the 22nd that’s open to the public. Feel free to stop by and say hi if you’ll be around.
