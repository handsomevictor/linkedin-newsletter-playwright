#125: Asset segregation in the hot seat as Bacen consultation concludes
Plus: Receita Federal finds 25,000 Brazilians who didn't declare bitcoin on their taxes; Hashdex hits bitcoin ETF roadblock in US

Ol√° pessoal!

Welcome back to üáßüá∑Brazil Crypto Report. I hope everyone had a good holiday season. We‚Äôre returning to our standard weekly publishing schedule after a busy January and then some much needed time off.

I made the trek to Switzerland for World Economic Forum last month where I helped put together Filecoin Foundation‚Äôs activation on the Davos Promenade, networked like crazy and snuck in a few ski outings.

I was fortunate to run into a bunch of awesome Brazil crypto folks like Andre Portilho from BTG Pactual and Sophia Lopez from Kaleido while I was on the ground!

As you all know, crypto in Brazil never sleeps so there‚Äôs lots to catch up on - let‚Äôs dive in!

Have a great week everyone.

üéôNew podcasts!

ICYMI I published two must-listen podcast episodes over the last couple weeks with Rocelo Lopes and Rafael Castaneda (aka Casta Crypto).

Rocelo is one of the OGs of Brazil‚Äôs bitcoin scene and was the first commercial-sized bitcoin miner in Latin America. Castaneda, Brazil‚Äôs resident crypto giga-brain, sits down for a mind-bending conversation about technology and ethics, digital nation states, the modular vs monolithic blockchains, and more

Bacen consultation ends with no easy solution in sight for asset segregation

The comment window for the Banco Central do Brasil's much-anticipated public consultation on digital asset regulations closed January 31. A total of 240 comments were submitted to some 38 questions posed to the public by the bank. The submissions came from a mix of crypto exchanges, banks, law firms, trade associations, payment processors, other financial infrastructure operators and highly passionate community members.

As expected, the specific issue of asset segregation was the most fiercely debated in the submitted comments. There exists a wide consensus that a rule requiring asset segregation is necessary, but actually implementing this will be tricky.

üí° Recall that a rule that would have required crypto brokerages to segregate customer assets was removed from the legislation that was ultimately passed into law in late 2022 after the FTX collapse.

The issue has proven to be a thorn in the side of its proponents since then. The Central Bank explored ways to incorporate the rule into its forthcoming regulatory framework, but there are significant concerns regarding the constitutionality of this maneuver. This means that a legislative remedy is likely the only way that such a rule could withstand legal challenges.

Indeed, one of the bank‚Äôs goals in putting forth this consultation was to help find a solution to this asset segregation problem. But it‚Äôs not clear that we are any closer to an easy fix.

Numerous parties submitted comments in support of new legislation that would institute this requirement in one form or another. For example, B3, Cielo and ANBIMA argued in favor of a new bill that would require greater transparency and treat crypto brokerages the same way as traditional financial institutions with regards to custody and deposit questions.

Mastercard argued that new legislation must cover ‚Äúeven if indirectly, the liability of entities that provide private key custody services, bringing their responsibility closer to that of an ordinary asset custodian‚Äù.

Crypto exchanges Coinbase, Mercado Bitcoin oin and CoinEx Global also submitted comments in favor of an asset segregation rule.

Also supportive, BTG Pactual warned against overreach, arguing that overly rigid rules could ‚Äúcould prevent the market from developing and creating new products and services‚Äù.

What about Binance?

Binance, which is widely credited with stripping the asset segregation provision out of the crypto regulation bill before it became law, stated in its comments that it supports asset segregation in principle and currently maintains all of its client assets in separate brokerage accounts.

However, the world‚Äôs largest exchange argued against a hard asset segregation rule, instead advocating for a more ‚Äúholistic approach‚Äù so as to not impede efficiency gains native to blockchain tech. This approach would include concepts like proof of reserves. It wrote:

‚ÄúAlthough traditional finance generally requires the segregation of services, which generates the multiplication of necessary intermediaries, the combination of services in a Vasp results in greater efficiencies that benefit end users, which is an element of distinction that any regulatory structure must take into account. into account.‚Äù
What comes next?

The bank will use the 200+ comments to help it formulate a draft regulatory framework. It will then seek feedback on the proposal from the public in a second consultation, which is expected to be released this spring. The final infralegal framework is expected to be finalized in the third quarter of this year.

In the meantime, expect to see more momentum for new enabling legislation in the Brazilian Congress in the coming months.

As Diego Perez z, president of ABFintechs, explained to Valor:

‚ÄúIt is important that this issue is addressed in a law so that we have sufficient legal certainty to demonstrate how effective this asset segregation would be.‚Äù

If you want to read for yourself the various comments submitted (all in Portuguese), you can find the full list here. Fabr√≠cio Tota of Mercado Bitcoin also had a good opinion take in his E-investidor column for Estad√£o that‚Äôs worth a read.

Hashdex wins approval for US spot bitcoin ETF, but it has yet to launch

The good news is that the Rio de Janeiro-based asset manager earned the SEC‚Äôs approval to convert its bitcoin futures ETF (DEFI) into a mixed product that includes both spot bitcoin and bitcoin futures.

The bad news is that because Hashdex‚Äôs proposal was quite unique and more complex than those submitted by the other 10 bitcoin ETF applicants, the formal conversion hasn‚Äôt actually happened yet due to administrative and paperwork backlogs.

This means that Hashdex‚Äôs DEFI fund is still trading as a bitcoin futures ETF and waiting on the SEC, while the other spot bitcoin ETF issuers are off to the races in the so-called ‚ÄúCointucky Derby‚Äù.

The company explained in a statement:

"The product currently operates in the United States through the purchase of Bitcoin futures, and Hashdex is working with regulators to convert to the spot model soon."

Recall that the US regulator approved 11 bitcoin ETFs for launch on January 10 (the day after some comical cybersecurity breaches on the SEC‚Äôs X/Twitter account). This batch of approvals included Hashdex‚Äôs DEFI product (which the firm says will be renamed at a future date). You can see the full press release from Hashdex here regarding the approval.

Does this delay threaten the product‚Äôs eventual success? I‚Äôm not enough of an ETF expert to opine with much authority here, but I do know that we are still early in what will be a very long game ‚Äî so it‚Äôs too early to jump to any hard conclusions IMO.

üéâ Irrespective - a huge kudos to the Hashdex team is in order as they‚Äôve been playing a critical role in driving the narrative on this topic and helping to put the necessary pressure on the SEC to finally approve these products after 10 years of delays.

üåô B3 looks to extend trading hours for bitcoin futures

Brazil‚Äôs primary stock exchange plans to extend trading hours for Ibovespa derivatives and eventually bitcoin futures, once the CVM approves the product. The extended trading session would start between 6-7pm and end at 10pm.

CEO Gilson Finkelsztain explained the reasoning:

"There's a significant number of people who wish to trade at the end of the day. We perceive a certain pent-up demand for such an operation‚Ä¶These are two products that could already be tested with investors for extended hours."

üíÄ Receita Federal finds 25,000 Brazilians who did not declare bitcoin in their income tax filings

The Receita Federal, Brazil‚Äôs tax authority, used artificial intelligence to identify more than 25,000 people who own bitcoin but did not declare it on their income tax filings.

Each of the individuals would have at least 0.05 bitcoin in their wallets; the total value of the undeclared bitcoin is R$1.06 billion (US$200 million).

The authority has been signaling to the public for the last year that they have ways of identifying and tracking individuals who do not declare. Apparently they were not bluffing.

Coinbase sees Brazil as ‚Äúpriority country‚Äù, ramps up local presence

Coinbase is elevating its presence in Brazil after laying low in the market since its official launch last March.

In an interview with Portal do Bitcoin, Fabio Tonetto Plein, Coinbase‚Äôs director for the Americas, explained that the company now has 35 employees fully dedicated to supporting its Brazilian operation. Indeed, the market has become a priority in the exchange‚Äôs global expansion efforts.

‚ÄúCoinbase sees Brazil as a promising market due to the constructive stance of regulators, such as the Central Bank and the CVM, who are willing to collaborate in the development of the cryptocurrency industry in the country.‚Äù

He explained that Coinbase is formally incorporated in the country as Coinbase Brasil and follows all relevant rules - including reporting customer transaction data to the Receita Federal.

Coinbase also submitted comments to the Central Bank in its recent public consultation. On the flashpoint issue of asset segregation, Plein explained that the exchange is in favor of the concept in principle, but notes that is important to ensure that such a rule isn‚Äôt overly restrictive - an approach taken by several other submitters.

Coinbase is also in the process of joining the Brazilian Internet Association (Abranet), which has a mix of other crypto and technology companies in its member ranks.

Plein also explained that Coinbase is open to M&A activity in Brazil should the right opportunity arise. He explained:

‚ÄúWe have an arm that is Coinbase Ventures, an investment fund in crypto and Web 3 around the world and which is super active. [‚Ä¶] In fact, also in Brazil, the company is often exploring these investment opportunities.‚Äù

üëä BCR will have a podcast interview with Plein coming out later this month so be sure to keep an eye out for that.
