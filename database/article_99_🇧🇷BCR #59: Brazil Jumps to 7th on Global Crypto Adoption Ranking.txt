Bom dia pessoal!

I hope everyone had a great Merge week!

After collecting some feedback from various readers the last few weeks, I‚Äôve decided to add a new section to this weekly newsletter focusing on crypto developments elsewhere in Latin America.

I‚Äôve thought about this for a while but was reluctant mainly because I just don‚Äôt know as much about the other Latam countries as I do about Brazil. But there seems to be interest from readers and the only way to learn is to just start and figure it out as I go.

With that, I wanted to flag two CoinDesk articles that I thought did a great job of highlighting two critical Latam stories - El Salvador and Argentina.

The reason I‚Äôve always tried staying away from El Salvador stuff is that media coverage of it always seems to be heavily slanted in a particular direction. Mainstream media takes the view that the whole experiment is a scam being imposed on the population by a reckless authoritarian president; crypto media homerists and bitcoin curmudgeons on Twitter view President Nayib Bukele as a hero at the same level as Simon Bolivar. In this context, one has to assume that everything you‚Äôre hearing is just propaganda and not reflective of reality.

That said, I really enjoyed this David Morris piece that examines El Salvador‚Äôs bitcoin experiment one year in, entitled 1 Year of Bitcoin in El Salvador: The Bad, The Good, The Ugly. This is probably the most well thought through and balanced take on El Salvador I‚Äôve seen in some, if not ever, so definitely recommend taking a look.

The next is a piece by Leah Callon-Butler about a recent visit to Argentina where she examines the relationship between locals and stablecoins amid ongoing economic uncertainty and inflation.

Thanks to everyone for reading and I hope you enjoy this week‚Äôs edition!
