👋 Hello!

I hope everyone is having another great ATH week. I wanted to flag some exciting news regarding this year’s Ethereum Rio event. 

You may have seen the announcement last week that Antonio Neto and his team at Vega Crypto will be taking over the project. 🇧🇷Brazil Crypto Report is excited to announce that we will be joining him as the official media partner for the conference.

Antonio has been active in the Brazil crypto scene since 2013 and has deep roots and connections across the community, so BCR is super excited to be teaming up with him and his team to keep momentum going in 2024.

Ethereum Rio will now take place May 13-15, 2024. The venue and more details will be formally announced shortly once contracts are finalized.

💪 I highly encourage everyone to get this event on their calendars

The first two editions of ETH Rio (2022 and 2023) were wildly successful, as it is one of the few “must-attend” crypto events in Brazil that convenes builders, investors and stakeholders from across the ecosystem. 

💡Further, this conference has historically been a great learning opportunity for gringos looking to learn more about the Brazil market and connect with local stakeholders. 

Themes for this year’s version will include: 

Drex and Brazil as a testing ground for a tokenized economy built on EVM
DePIN (decentralized physical infrastructure networks)
RWAs 
Layer 2 ecosystems; modular vs monolithic blockchains 
Capital markets
Startup spotlight
The builders’ funnel in Brazil

More details will be released as they become available. Meanwhile, we need YOUR help to make this event epic:
