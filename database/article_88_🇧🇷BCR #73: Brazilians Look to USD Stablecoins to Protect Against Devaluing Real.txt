Ola pessoal!

Welcome to the final edition of üáßüá∑Brazil Crypto Report for 2023! It‚Äôs been an incredible year+ building out this product. I want to take a quick moment to express my gratitude as I‚Äôve enjoyed the opportunity to meet and interact with numerous readers personally over the last few months.

While the market dynamics across crypto and macro more generally look quite grim at the moment, the thesis of BCR has remained unchanged: Brazil is the most overlooked crypto market in the world and will be major driver of global adoption in the coming years.

Some BCR milestones from 2022:

~2,000 total subscribers across Substack and Linkedin
Readers in more than 20 countries
~80,000 page views
Average of ~1,150 views per newsletter
31 podcast episodes published
~4,000 podcast downloads

That‚Äôs pretty exciting for a media product focusing on such a niche vertical. I‚Äôd like to send a special thanks to everyone who has supported me in this venture over the last 18 months, and I‚Äôm excited to continue building this throughout the bear marketüí™

Have a great week everyone and thanks for reading!

Binance‚Äôs First Brazil Employee Steps Down

Mayra Siqueira, Binance‚Äôs first employee in Brazil, has stepped down from her role after three years at the company leading Brazil marketing efforts. She announced the transition via a Linkedin post.

Her resignation comes amid a broader leadership change at Binance Brasil. (Relatively) recent hires include director of institutional relations Daniel Mangabeira, public relations director Carolina Matos and director-general Guilherme Nazar.

Siqueira previously worked for the Brazilian brokerage Foxbit and intends to stay in the crypto industry, per Portal do Bitcoin.

In related news, Mercado Bitcoin CEO Reinaldo Rabelo in a Linkedin post took aim at Binance‚Äôs tactics of hiring politically-connected individuals in the Brazil market, going so far as to compare the tactics to those used by FTX.

"We do not believe in this model linked to politics. We believe in blockchain and new business models. This 'collusion' with the State is something we abhor. FTX adopted this model. Today, we know that it bought favors from many politicians around the world to hide their shenanigans. It came to what happened." (Livecoins)

üìà Markets

Brazilians are using stablecoins to hedge against the devaluation of the Real, per a new study by crypto data provider Kaiko. The report, which examined transactions on Binance and Bitso, shows that more than half of the trading pairs involving the Real are with dollar-pegged stablecoins and that 50% of BRL trading volumes involve a stablecoin. Kaiko wrote in its report:

‚ÄúSince the 2021 bull market, stablecoin USDT has increased its share of real volume by 20%, at the expense of altcoins, which suggests that Brazilians are opting for stablecoin safety over altcoin speculation.‚Äù (Portal do Bitcoin)
