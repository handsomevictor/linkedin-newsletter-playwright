Fala pessoal!

Greetings and welcome to 🇧🇷Brazil Crypto Report for the week of July 18-22. I hope everyone had a great weekend. I spent some time at the local airshow with my son checking out World War II era fighter planes. It was a nice change of pace from languishing over crypto prices 😂..

Thanks as always for reading and I hope you enjoy this week’s edition

🗺SBF Looks to Brazil

When SBF speaks, the world listens. 30 year-old crypto billionaire and industry rescuer-in-chief Sam Bankman-Fried now has his eye on expanding FTX in Brazil and Latam, he revealed in a conversation with Bloomberg’s Matt Levine.

While he emphasized that there isn’t a specific acquisition or proposal in the works, he said that he is looking at how token offerings could be conducted in markets like Brazil and Mexico.

“I don’t believe there is anything concrete at the moment, we would love to and we are having talks with possible partners in Latin America.”

He also emphasized that he believes crypto usage in Latam will increase particularly around the remittance use case and that cryptos, particularly stablecoins pegged to national currencies, will eventually be used for payments.

🔥Mercado Bitcoin CEO Turns Up Heat on Foreign Exchanges

Anyone who follows Reinaldo Rabelo’s Linkedin feed knows he isn’t shy in his criticism of Binance, but this week he took aim at the broader range of foreign competitors. In an interview with Neofeed, he accused Crypto.com, Coinbase, FTX, Gemini and Paxos of operating in the same extra-legal grey area in Brazil in the same manner as Binance.

“[L]ike Binance, there are Crypto.com, Coinbase, FTX, Gemini, Paxos. All acting in the same way…All of them exploit the fragility of the inspection apparatus of our State. Many of them operate in other markets and respect them. How does FTX operate in the United States? How does Binance operate in the United States? How does Coinbase operate in the United States? It's very different from how they work here….With the model they use here, FTX, Binance and Coinbase were kicked out of other countries.”

In response to a question if Binance should be expelled from Brazil, he responded:

“In this model, yes. We don't need explorers in our economy, we need investors in our economy. We need to attract good money, not exploitation money.”

Thiago Cesar, CEO of Transfero and frequent Rabelo critic on Linkedin, posted the following not inaccurate response:

The crypto-regulation debate in Brazil boils down to three sides: a pathetic anti-competitive lobby promoted by local exchanges (who are having their asses kicked by Binance, FTX, Crypto.com, Bybit, etc), legacy banks who always frowned upon crypto but are now trying to portrait themselves as "crypto is cool as long as we control it" and the rest of the market who couldn't care less about fake narratives and pragmatically chooses the best service providers.
Don't get fooled by false narratives from people who never followed the "ethos" of crypto.
💪Binance Boosts its Advocacy Game

Binance took a big step to bolster its presence and advocacy efforts in Brazil by joining the Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Committee of the Brazilian Chamber of Digital Economy as a founding member. The organization was created in 2001 and counts major tech players like Facebook, TikTok, Nubank, Visa and Uber among its members. Daniel Mangabeira, Binance’s head of Institutional Relations and primary Brazil spokesperson, will serve as the crypto committee’s coordinator. He commented:

“The Committee, a pioneer in the sector, will allow the positioning of agents in the segment and the construction of proposals for the development and expansion of this industry. The discussion involves the regulatory debate, which is of paramount importance, as well as the construction of the digital community, creating conditions that allow the use of crypto assets in the most beneficial and inclusive way for users, investors and society as a whole.”

The move marks Binance’s first move to join a multilateral advocacy or lobbying trade group in Brazil

⭐️I highly recommend this “State of Bankless Brasil” write up in the BanklessDAO newsletter (in English). In just a year, Bankless Brasil has built a community of 1200 members on Discord and 2,000 newsletter subscribers, and they’re producing and translating a lot of great Portuguese language crypto content.

🎙Be sure to check out the latest episodes of the 🇧🇷Brazil Crypto Report podcast. Last week I had the pleasure of interviewing Brazilian UFC fighters Matheus Nicolau and Luana Pinheiro about their decision to accept part of their salary in bitcoin.

I also sat down with Sabrina Tachdjian, head of payments and fintech at HBAR Foundation to discuss the HBAR grants program, what types of projects in Latam they are looking to seed, and what a successful application looks like.

🙏 Thanks to our partners at HBAR Foundation for supporting 🇧🇷 Brazil Crypto Report! If you're a Latam entrepreneur or developer with an up-and-coming project or idea and need some support, take a look at the HBAR grant program. They're seeding projects focused on DeFi, fintech, NFTs, sustainability and so much more. They also offer a plethora of other resources to help builders bootstrap. Do yourself a favor and check them out! 👊
