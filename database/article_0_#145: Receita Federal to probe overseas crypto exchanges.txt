#145: Receita Federal to probe overseas crypto exchanges
Plus: Arthur Inc opens mining facility in Oklahoma; Hashdex files for mixed bitcoin + ether ETF in US

Ol√° pessoal! 

Welcome back to üáßüá∑Brazil Crypto Report for the week of June 17-21, and happy Febraban Tech week for everyone attending! 

I spent the weekend following the drama around LayerZero and some of the other big platforms that have done airdrops recently. I used to be super bullish on airdrops as a user acquisition strategy, but honestly things have gotten completely out of control with sybils and industrial farming. 

For more color, see this X thread by a guy claiming to have been farming zkSync from 350 unique wallets and then complaining that his compensation wasn‚Äôt fair. Also worth a listen to this Laura Shin podcast episode with LayerZero Labs founder Bryan Pellegrino discussing his novel but ineffective approach to fighting off sybils. 

It‚Äôs really hard to see a credible path forward for airdrops right now, as it seems to be creating more problems than it is solving at this point. I‚Äôm going to call the top and say we‚Äôve reached ‚Äúpeak airdrop‚Äù. 

Don‚Äôt get me started on this Martin Shkreli/$DJT memecoin nonsense üò±

Anyways, let‚Äôs jump into the news. 

üîçWhat‚Äôs in this week‚Äôs BCR?

Receita Federal to probe foreign crypto exchanges

Brazil‚Äôs tax authority will examine foreign crypto exchanges operating in Brazil, with an eye toward their business models and relationships they have with local service providers.

The Receita Federal published an ordinance last week establishing a working group, called GT Criptoativos, focusing on tax compliance of overseas crypto exchanges in the country. The objectives are to provide guidance on tax obligations ‚Äî such as Normative Instruction 1888 which requires brokerages to report customer trading activity to the agency, better capture information about depositors and withdrawers from these platforms, and establish a plan of action if the brokers fail to comply.

The ordinance states:

"the activities referred to in the caput include, among others, holding meetings with institutions providing payment services in the country of international exchanges."

Among the exchanges presumably targeted by this include Binance, OKX and Kucoin, though it doesn‚Äôt appear that any of these have officially received a summons. 

Andrea Chaves, Undersecretary of Inspection at the Receita Federal, told Reuters:

"it is an area of concern for us to first understand how they [international brokers] operate here, whether there is any illegality or not. Also We are concerned about having information here about Brazilian wealth subject to taxation".

Hashdex files for new mixed bitcoin + ether product in the US 

The Rio de Janeiro-based crypto asset manager has filed for a new ETF in the US that tracks the Nasdaq Crypto Index. If approved, it would be the first ETF product in the US market to hold multiple cryptos. 

The NCI is composed of both bitcoin and ether (90.85%), in addition to altcoins such as Chainlink, Polygon, Solana and more. Hashdex‚Äôs flagship HASH11 product in Brazil also tracks the NCI

However, the proposed US ETF would only invest in bitcoin and ether, as those are the only two coins that been approved to trade through regulated vehicles. It explicitly will not invest in ‚Äúcrypto securities, tokenized assets or stablecoins.‚Äù 

BitGo and Coinbase would be the custodians of the fund. The US Securities and Exchange Commission has until March 2025 to respond to the request.

Parfin rolls out new blockchain network Rayls

Parfin is replacing its old Parchain with a new product called Rayls. The tool is in play to be a scalable privacy solution for Drex, and will ideally integrate banks and other financial institutions with decentralized finance. 

One of the core improvements of Rayls over Parchain is that it is possible to use the network in a fully permissioned way through the Rayls Public Chain ‚Äî which functions as an Ethereum Layer 2. 

Parfin CTO Alex B. explained that Parfin is trying to fill a gap that exists with existing permissioned solutions like Hyperledger Besu, which don‚Äôt natively integrate with public chains like Solana, Ethereum, etc: 

‚ÄúToday there is a barrier between the world of traditional finance and what we call DeFi, which takes place on public blockchains.‚Äù

Inside of Drex, Rayls will likely be tested together with Microsoft‚Äôs ZKP Nova.

Arthur Inc opens 15 mw bitcoin mining farm in Oklahoma

The Brazilian-owned bitcoin miner has opened a new facility in Oklahoma with 6,800 square meters and 15 megawatts of energy capacity. 

The site has an agreement with Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company to provide electricity at a price of US$0.04 per kilowatt hour. Oklahoma recently passed a law protecting investors in bitcoin and other digital assets. 

Co-founder Rud√° Pellini explained:

‚ÄúOklahoma has one of the best energy costs in the country. The mining companies have a partnership to encourage operations, because it benefits the grid‚Äù 

The new unit will be focused on hosting, in which it provides space to companies who have bitcoin mining machines but nowhere to run them. 

‚ÄúWe already have 1,500 (high performance computers) installed and 3,500 arriving at the new unit‚Äù

Arthur already has mining facilities in Ohio and Wyoming.
