Chamber of Deputies approves 15% tax on overseas crypto holdings

Legislation that expands the taxation of offshore financial holdings was approved by Brazil‚Äôs Chamber of Deputies. This package includes a 15 percent taxation rate on cryptocurrencies.

The tax targets Brazilian users of offshore crypto exchanges such as Binance, Coinbase, Bitget, Crypto.com and others. If passed by the Senate and signed into law, it would come into effect in 2024. 

The original text of the bill sought a tax rate as high as 22 percent on crypto assets. An amendment was filed during the process seeking the exclusion of digital assets, but it was ultimately rejected. 

Guilherme Peloso Araujo, a tax expert at the firm Carvalho Borges Ara√∫jo, commented:

‚ÄúIt hits hard on individuals who have investments in Binance and others abroad.‚Äù

The Receita Federal would need to define which cryptocurrencies will be subject to this tax and the actions that would trigger a tax event. 

Digital asset tax specialist Dayana Uhdre identified several problems with the proposal, primarily a lack of differentiation between types of tokens: 

"The proposal talks about virtual assets, but it could differentiate between payment tokens, utility tokens and security tokens. Under legislation needs to resolve this, because they are different things.‚Äù

Attorney Daniel de Paiva Gomes also pointed out several unanswered questions in the legislation, telling Portal do Bitcoin: 

‚ÄúWill cryptoassets cover any type of native cryptoasset for the functioning of a blockchain? So I ask: will utility tokens, which give access to goods and services and are not financial assets, be placed within the concept of cryptoassets as comparable to financial applications?‚Äù

The text now goes to the Senate.

CVM to intensify scrutiny over crypto industry

The CVM, Brazil‚Äôs securities regulator, is beginning a new initiative to map out the different institutions that operate in the digital asset space within the country. The move comes as part of a broader effort to heighten its monitoring of companies operating in the industry and their activities. 

Beginning the week of October 30, the agency will begin sending letters to 64 market participants inquiring about their respective roles, structures and how they fit in the overall market. These inquiries will be followed by onsite technical visits at certain entities. 

The project is part of the agency‚Äôs 2023 Risk-Based Supervision plan, which includes a heavy focus on the digital asset industry, and the CVM will use the information to guide and define its regulatory policy and supervisory actions.

Vera Sim√µes, superintendent of strategic risk supervision at the agency, explained: 

‚ÄúWe want to know the terrain, who works and what is offered. Our intention is to understand how the market works, how it is organized, who the main actors are and what the main risk mitigators are.‚Äù

Another motivation for initiative is provide more clarity to the market on token offering classifications.

‚ÄúThe CVM has been receiving inquiries about token offerings being characterized as securities or not. Being close and communicating efficiently with market agents is one of the ways to ensure correct action and security in the capital market‚Äù

It‚Äôs worth noting that the CVM has faced significant staffing and resource challenges in recent years, so this initiative should help the agency to better stay on top of market participants and developments given its current constraints.

Binance tried to block vote on CPI report, committee rapporteur says

In an interview with Portal do Bitcoin, Federal Deputy and CPI rapporteur Ricardo Silva doubled down on the committee‚Äôs findings on Binance. He argued that the exchange had committed financial crimes and tax evasion, while enabling crypto pyramid scheme operators to launder investor money out of the country using the platform:

‚ÄúBinance was used for the crime. The CPI showed all the pyramids, incredibly all, had operations with Binance. All of them. There wasn't one that did not.‚Äù

He also revealed some last minute drama as Binance ramped up pressure to block a vote on the final report. 

Binance pressed until the last day for a non-vote on the report. They were looking for a deputy to ask for a review to block the report. They tried, called the office, pressured deputies not to vote. There were deputies who came to talk to us about the possibility of requesting a review because Binance put pressure on it. There was pressure from Binance. But they didn‚Äôt succeed.‚Äù

Silva also emphasized that he‚Äôs optimistic about the fate of the four pieces of legislation recommended by the CPI in the Congress, due to his leadership in the PSD party and Deputy Aureo Ribeiro‚Äôs position atop Solidariedade.

üèõ Policy, Regulation and Enforcement

Joao Andre Pereira, head of regulation at the Banco Central do Brasil, again expressed the need for a legislative solution to the asset segregation question. In an interview with Exame, he said:

‚ÄúThe issue of asset segregation is something very relevant, we have been looking at it in BC. We have ways of dealing with it without asset segregation, but this has a much higher cost. It is important that there is an adjustment to the law. Asset segregation is positive and is something that should be done.‚Äù

Pereira also provided additional color on the amount of time he has spent interfacing with market participants discussing the incoming regulatory framework, which is expected to be unveiled mid-2024. He explained:

‚ÄúWe talk a lot with the market, but I don't think I've ever talked as much with non-regulated entities as in recent months to understand the issue and build regulation that is efficient and allows for development and at the same time we create conditions and limits so as not to have major problems. We are designing this regulation very close to the market.‚Äù

CVM superintendent Daniel Maeda said that he is impressed by the maturity of the crypto industry in Brazil following a tumultous 12 months of collapses and bankruptcies. Speaking at the Blockchain Finance Brazil event in S√£o Paulo, he explained:

Our industry shielded itself very well‚Ä¶There was a loss of assets, because the price of assets fell, but customers did not come to complain to the CVM.‚Äù (Valor)
