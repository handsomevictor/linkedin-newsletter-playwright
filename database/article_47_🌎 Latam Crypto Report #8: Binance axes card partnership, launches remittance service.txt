Binance ends Mastercard partnership, launches remittance service

Binance leads the news this week with two news items. The global exchange reportedly plans to end its card partnership with Mastercard, and Binance launched a new crypto transfer service in the region. 

Binance and Mastercard to end crypto card partnership 

Binance and Mastercard will end their crypto card partnership on September 22, CoinTelegraph and others reported. 

The partnerships affect credit cards from Binance and Mastercard issued in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Bahrain. 
Cardholders use the cards to spend money in local currencies while funding those purchases with their Binance crypto balance. 
Binance did not give specifics on why it is ending the program, although Bloomberg Línea noted that Mastercard and Visa are distancing themselves from the exchange as it faces regulatory issues in several jurisdictions.

Circle and Mercado Pago to offer USDC in Chile

Circle has partnered with e-commerce giant Mercado Pago to access its dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDC. Mercado Pago Senior Director Matias Spagui said: 

“The US dollar is one of the most stable currencies in the world and a simple vehicle to ensure wealth preservation amidst general uncertainty. With the launch of this stablecoin we seek to diversify access to cryptocurrencies and offer the more than two million Mercado Pago users an alternative that matches the value of the dollar.”
