Receita Federal releases new crypto tax changes

Brazil‚Äôs tax authority has released new rules for crypto asset reporting. Crypto traders and investors must now identify whether their crypto assets are stablecoins, altcoins or bitcoin.

Taxpayers must also report the CNPJ (unique business identifier) of the entity that serving as the custodian for the crypto assets.

Those holding cryptos in foreign brokerages will also see their declaration process change, pursuant to Law 14,754/2023, which was passed last year and created new rules for Brazilians with overseas assets. However, not all cryptos will be subject to this law. The agency said by March 15 it would issue further guidance on tax treatment for overseas crypto assets.

Jos√© Carlos da Fonseca, national supervisor of the agency‚Äôs income tax program, said in an press conference:

‚ÄúBefore you declared the cryptoactive and put a description. Now, you will be required to select what type of crypto you have. If it is an altcoin it will open a list, if it is a stablecoin it will open another list.‚Äù

BRICS to create blockchain-based payment system to rival dollar

The BRICS group of countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) will work to build a blockchain-based payment system with the goal of increasing the bloc‚Äôs importance in the international monetary system and increasing settlement in non-USD currencies.

Kremlin spokesman Yury Ushakov told Russian state news agency TASS:

‚ÄúWe believe that creating an independent BRICS payment system is an important goal for the future, which would be based on state-of-the-art tools such as digital technologies and blockchain. The main thing is to make sure it is convenient for governments, common people and businesses, as well as cost-effective and free of politics.‚Äù

Ushakov added that the system, called BRICS Bridge, would enable ‚Äúeconomic and politics-free‚Äù payments for everyone, including governments and ‚Äúordinary people.‚Äù

Binance‚Äôs compliance chief visits Brazil

Noah Perlman, Chief Compliance Officer at the world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, passed through Brazil last week to meet with local partners and authorities in Rio de Janeiro and Brasilia.

The visit comes several months after Binance reached a US$4.3 billion settlement with the US government over lapses in its anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing practices. The settlement saw the ousting of Changpeng Zhao as CEO and the installation of a US government appointed ‚Äúmonitor‚Äù who will point any compliance flaws to authorities.

Binance Brasil came under heavy pressure in Brazil last year during a special congressional investigation into financial pyramids. The committee asserted that most of the major crypto pyramid scheme operators in Brazil used Binance to send customer funds out of the country. The committee also urged the Central Bank of Brazil to reject Binance‚Äôs bid to acquire the Sim;paul brokerage - a move that would make a the exchange a regulated institution under the Central Bank.

In an interview with Valor's Toni Sciarretta, Perlman explained that Binance has ramped up globally its investments on the compliance side of the business following the settlement, with an intent to minimize opportunities for jurisdictional arbitrage.

Perlman elaborated:

‚ÄúWe intend to have a globally consistent model, with real connection between teams. We have similar standards and processes, but we know that each region has specific issues. Therefore, we rely on local knowledge, ensuring compliance with all rules, requirements and expectations of regulators.‚Äù

Further, having the monitor in place gives institutional counterparties and traders an extra degree of certainty that best practices are being adhered to, he explained:

‚ÄúThere will probably be no other safer ‚Äòcrypto‚Äô platform to operate on than ours in the next five years.‚Äù
CVM‚Äôs case against Binance could take another 3 years

A lawsuit against Binance by Brazil‚Äôs securities regulator could take several more years to complete, even though the CVM reckoned that the case ‚Äúappears to be less complex‚Äù than matters normally considered by the agency.

The maximum period of time for considering the lawsuit is 1,518 days, with 598 days already having elapsed. The agency disclosed the information to Fernando Martines of Portal do Bitcoin in a response to a freedom of information request.

The CVM re-opened its case against Binance in July 2022 after it was revelealed that the exchange was continuing to offer derivatives products to Brazilian customers despite a stop order.
