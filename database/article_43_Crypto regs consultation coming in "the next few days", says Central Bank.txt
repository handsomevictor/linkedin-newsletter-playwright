Crypto regs consultation coming in "the next few days", says Central Bank
Plus: CPI summons bank records of Brazil's largest exchanges; record 4.1 million Brazilians traded crypto in July

Ol√° pessoal!

Welcome to üáßüá∑Brazil Crypto Report for the week of September 25-29, 2023!

It was great catching up with many of you in S√£o Paulo last week at several events and conferences around town. I remain impressed by the extent to which the narrative in Brazil is much more positive right now than in the US and in other ‚Äúwestern‚Äù countries. I believe there is something really special brewing here, and this is what inspires me to keep creating content exploring this market. 

As always, thanks for reading and have a great week!

For this week‚Äôs podcast episode I talked to Taynaah Reis onsite at the Blockchain Rio event earlier this month. Taynaah first learned to code at 12 years old and started her own company at 16, and she‚Äôs been an entrepreneur and builder in the blockchain world since 2017. 

I also had the opportunity to join Felipe Cabral of the Let‚Äôs Crypto podcast to record a crossover interview with Rodrigoh Henriques, director of innovation at Fenasbac. This interview is in Portuguese, so apologies to my English-only readers (and thanks to everyone for tolerating my gringo Portuguese). I promise to track down Rodrigoh soon for a proper chat in English.

üíî CPI votes to break bank secrecy, summon bank records for Brazilian crypto exchanges

The special congressional committee investigating financial pyramids moved to break bank and tax secrecy protections for the major crypto exchanges operating in the country. 

The impacted exchanges are Mercado Bitcoin, Grupo Foxbit, NovaDAX, Ripio , Bitso Brasil, Bitcoin Trade, BitcoinToYou, Coinext and Digitra.com . 

Records for Binance Holding UY S.A, Binance Capital Management CO, Binance Capital Management CO and Wellington Participa√ß√µes LTDA will also be unsealed. Earlier this month, the committee broke bank secrecy for Binance and B Fintech, Binance‚Äôs local operating company. 

The justification for the summons is that obtaining these records will provide visibility into the flow of funds, particularly in cases where investor funds went missing. Deputy Ricardo Silva, author of the request, explained:

‚ÄúThe breach of confidentiality required here will greatly contribute to the work of this technical body, as it will make it possible to recognize the path taken by investors' money‚Äù

The CPI also summoned records for LTW Consult, Interag Consultoria, Rental Coins, Holy Spirit Invest, FMS Eventos, Forces Produ√ß√µes e Eventos, Grow Up Club, E-Dinheiro Brasil, One World Services (OWS) and ex-footballer Ronaldinho Gaucho.

Bacen to release crypto regulation consultation ‚Äúin the next few days‚Äù

Joao Andre Pereira, head of the financial system regulation department at the Banco Central do Brasil, said that the first public consultation on crypto regulation will be published ‚Äúin the next few days‚Äù at the Fintouch 2023 event, hosted by ABFintechs, last week.

‚ÄúWe still have great difficulty even conceptualizing when we enter this world. This is not trivial. ‚ÄòStablecoins‚Äô, for example, have different definitions‚Ä¶This should come out now, within this quarter, in the next few days, let‚Äôs put it that way.‚Äù

The first consultation will deal with defining activities of virtual asset service providers with the objective of obtaining feedback from the market. A second consultation, expected to come out toward the end of the year, will include a draft regulation. 

‚ÄúSome points we will try to discuss legislatively, such as property segregation, for example. Crypto ‚Äòas a service‚Äô is another thing we have to look at.‚Äù

At a separate event hosted by ABcripto - Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Criptoeconomia, Nagel Paulino from the bank‚Äôs regulation department offered several teasers about what would be in the proposed regulations. 

He stated that the regulation will be implemented in stages, with the first stage being one of defining the types of VASPs that will be allowed to operate and the respective sets of rules they must follow. These will include rules related to preventing money laundering and terrorist financing; minimizing risks of hacking, theft and fraud; and Know Your Customer and Know Your Transaction programs. 

Other requirements will include audit, governance and compliance for regulated agents operating in the market segment: 

‚ÄúRequest for cyber security, competitive and business practices, problem-solving mechanisms and, finally, the banking system‚Äôs relationship registry for judicial purposes.‚Äù

He also emphasized that the main purpose of the initial consultation is to get generate feedback from stakeholders and market participants. He told Portal do Bitcoin: 

‚ÄúOur intention was to bring a normative act to be discussed with the general public. But for international regulation, or some doubts regarding local regulation, we decided to carry out a public consultation first, with more on concepts and suggestions.‚Äù

Paulino also highlighted that the Bank had carried out a mapping and study of crypto regulations around the world, and that there has been a particular focus on the MiCa framework being implemented in Europe. 

Additionally, Central Bank president Roberto Campos Neto signaled that the institution will look to ‚Äútighten‚Äù crypto regulations in the country, with a particular focus on the growing use of stablecoins. During testimony before the committee on Finance and Taxation in the Chamber of Deputies, he stated: 

"We understand that there are a lot of things, let's say, that are linked to tax evasion, or that are linked to illicit activities that are taking place in this world of cryptocurrencies‚Ä¶we are trying to tighten regulation, making brokers start to be inspected by the Central Bank."

Transfero installs Marlyson Silva as CEO 

BRZ stablecoin issuer Transfero Group swapped chief executives, with co-founder M√°rlyson Silva replacing Thiago Cesar. The change comes shortly after the company obtained its payments institution license from the Central Bank. 

One of the reasons cited for the move is the company‚Äôs growing involvement in the Brazil market. With Cesar living in Europe, the time zone and geographic differences proved difficult. 

‚ÄúManaging teams remotely is very difficult. With Central Bank regulation, we began to participate in the Brazilian framework, so it would make sense to pass the baton‚Äù

Silva founded crypto payment gateway Bit.One in 2015. The company was acquired by Transfero two years later, where he assumed the role of co-founder and chief strategy officer. 

Cesar confirmed to Portal do Bitcoin that he had stepped down from the CEO role and left the company entirely:

‚ÄúI stepped down from the CEO position and will no longer be with Transfero‚Ä¶I'm living in Europe and have other personal life plans (family, etc.). I decided to pass the baton to Marlyson Silva, who was also a founding partner and lives in Brazil‚Äù.

ü™ô Drex (formerly Digital Real)

Central Bank president Roberto Campos Neto stated that the idea behind Drex is to reduce the costs of intermediating both financial and non-financial assets. The efficiencies will come from the fact that the currency will automatically generate legally valid contracts for essentially zero cost. The remarks came at an event hosted by 1618 Investimentos. (InfoMoney)
The consortium made up of Elo, Caixa Economica and Microsoft executed the first successful purchase of a federal bond using the Drex network. The operation took place in the Central Bank‚Äôs testing environment. The consortium elaborated in a statement:

"the exchange of assets was carried out instantly, known as Delivery Versus Payment, or DvP in English, made possible by blockchain technology. The transaction represents a record and was carried out in five seconds, an advance technological period in comparison with the standard period of up to two business days.‚Äù (Exame)

üèõ Policy, Regulation and Enforcement

The CVM granted the first license to a crypto company to sell fixed income tokens under a crowdfunding platform registration. Bruno de Freitas Gomes, Superintendent of Securitization at the CVM, made the revelation to Portal do Bitcoin but did not disclose the name of the company.

‚ÄúThere is now a movement for tokenizers to come and register as a platform, this is already happening. We already gave the first record in this case yesterday. I just can‚Äôt comment on the specific case.‚Äù

Peer-to-peer crypto marketplaces and platforms that enable the trading of ‚Äúutility tokens‚Äù must now follow the same rules as brokers, per new guidance released by the Receita Federal. This means that these entities, whether they be based in Brazil or abroad, will be required to report the purchase and sale activities of customers to the agency pursuant to Normative Instruction 1888. The new guidance states: 

‚ÄúA legal entity, even non-financial, that provides a digital platform on which its users can carry out transactions with utility tokens directly between them (peer to peer transactions), is classified as an exchange, remaining obliged to provide the Special Secretariat of the Receita Federal do Brasil, information on transactions with its own crypto assets and those of its users. The legal entity issuing utility tokens must provide information about this operation to the RFB.‚Äù (Portal do Bitcoin) (Valor) (BlockNews) (InfoMoney)

Relatedly, the Receita Federal stated that market participants that offer services related to NFTs representing physical property, or mediate such transactions, do not need to report these activities to authorities. The new rule states: 

‚ÄúThe legal entity that offers services related to operations with NFT, representing a particular property, is not obliged to provide information related to operations with such NFT, according to IN 1.888, due to the fact that it does not fit into the concept of cryptoactive provided for in said normative instruction.‚Äù (Portal do Bitcoin) (Valor) (CoinTelegraph Brasil)

While the market waits for the Central Bank to release formal regulations for the crypto sector, companies like Mercado Bitcoin and Transfero are already implementing changes in line with recommendations issued by international organizations. Attorney Nicole Dyskant explained to Valor: 

‚ÄúThe BC is looking at the rules of the FSB [Financial Stability Board], the IMF and other bodies. It's not premature to think about this now. Controls are here to stay and being regulated in this area has advantages such as attracting more investment and more customer confidence.‚Äù
