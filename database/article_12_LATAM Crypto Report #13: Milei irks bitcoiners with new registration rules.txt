Argentina moves to register crypto companies

One of the biggest crypto stories in recent weeks is the news that Argentina created a registry for virtual asset service providers (VASPs).

Argentina’s securities regulator, Comisión Nacional de Valores (CNV), announced on March 25 that it had established the registry. It encouraged crypto providers to add personal data to continue operating in the market.

The new regulation aims to “identify the human and legal persons that provide services related to crypto assets in the country,” a CNV announcement states.
Any VASPs who don’t register “will not be able to operate in the country,” CNV President Roberto Silva stated in the announcement.
Argentina introduced the registry during a Financial Action Task Force (FATF) visit to the country, the CNV release said.
The registry launch comes after Argentina’s Senate unanimously approved modifying the penal code to introduce new anti-money laundering measures.

While Argentina’s decision to register crypto companies may seem straightforward on the face of it, the move has garnered intense criticism from bitcoiners and crypto enthusiasts hoping that Javier Milei’s self-proclaimed “anarcho-capitalism” stance would mean fewer barriers to using digital assets in the country.

Forbes points out that Milei inherited the law from the previous presidential administration.

The move reinforces an observation Latam Crypto Report pointed out a few months ago: Argentina isn’t El Salvador.

For more color on Argentina, have a listen to Aaron’s latest podcast interview with renowned journalist and author Michael J. Casey. Michael covered financial markets in Argentina for six years for the Wall Street Journal during the 2000s, and these experiences ultimately led him down the bitcoin rabbit hole. He brings a rich and informed outsider perspective to Argentina’s predicament.

Paraguay lawmakers propose temporary crypto mining ban

More legislative tension is playing out in Paraguay, which has attracted some high-profile bitcoin mining projects in recent months.

Highlighting concerns about clandestine crypto mines stealing energy, lawmakers proposed a bill to temporarily ban crypto mining in the country for 180 days. The story is developing, but here’s what we know so far:

The proposal wants to temporarily prohibit new crypto assets from being created in the country during that period, as well as the installation of new crypto mining farms. It also proposes suspending crypto storage activities “that require intensive electro energy from the national electrical grid for this purpose.”
Estimates from Paraguay’s national grid operator ANDE calculate that each clandestine crypto farm causes damages equivalent to about $68,000 to $95,000 worth of local currency.
A ban could cost Paraguay more than $200 million annually if approved, Hashlabs Mining Co-Founder Jaran Mellerud told Cointelegraph.
