New podcast

This week I‚Äôm joined by Brazil crypto media OG Gino Matos. Gino is currently a reporter at Crypto Briefing, but previously had stints covering Brazil for Cointelegraph Brasil and CriptoFacil. We talk about how Brazil‚Äôs crypto media environment has evolved over his time in the space, as well as his reporting highlights during those years.

Brazil‚Äôs crypto community rallies to assist Rio Grande do Sul relief

Crypto exchanges and operators in Brazil are kicking in to support Rio Grande do Sul ‚Äî the southernmost state that has been devastated by catastrophic rains and flooding this month.

Binance will donate up to US$1 million worth of BNB token vouchers to customers who live in the impacted area. Binance explained:

‚ÄúUsers living in affected cities in Rio Grande do Sul who have registered their proof of residence by May 6, 2024 will receive US$80 (R$408) in BNB token vouchers in their Rewards Hub.‚Äù

Mercado Bitcoin donated 75 Starlink devices to be used by local authorities involved in the rescue efforts. These units provide internet access via a satellite connection.

Grupo Foxbit, OKX, Bitso and Bybit Fintech Limited are running campaigns to match donations to relief efforts made by customers (up to R$150,000), while BRLA Digital has set up wallets to source crypto donations in USDT, USDC and BRLA on a variety of blockchains.

Crypto exchange Bitget also made a US$5,000 donation to Movimento Uni√£o BR to help distribute meals.

Bitcoin √© Aqui, a project to promote bitcoin adoption in the city of Rolante (and now has one of the highest adoption rates in the world) is also running a campaign to support the local hospital, which was completely destroyed in the flooding.

Mercado Bitcoin and Nathalia Arcuri team up on blockchain education

Arcuri, a personal finance influencer and founder of the Me Poupe! channel, is diving into the world of crypto education via a new partnership with MB. The effort will focus on distributing crypto content via YouTube and Instagram to a variety of new audiences, including traditional investors not familiar with crypto.

The first collaboration between the two came in December 2023 when Arcuri published material on tokenized fixed income products. She released another piece of content about the partnership in April about the bitcoin halving.

Arcuri, who has 7.6 million followers on YouTube and 3.3 million on Instagram, said in a statement:

‚ÄúThis partnership meets my main objective from the beginning: to bring financial education to as many people as possible and thus help more people achieve their dreams and independence. Knowledge about this world of cryptoassets is still very underexplored and it is great to find an institution that is willing to invest in disseminating safe information about the crypto market.‚Äù

Notably, the agreement between the two parties was formalized via a contract on the Polygon blockchain.

Ribeiro: Congress will approve crypto asset segregation in 2024

Aureo Ribeiro, author of legislation that would require crypto brokerages to segregate customer funds from operating funds, said this week that the Chamber of Deputies would approve his proposal by the end of 1H 2024 and send along a version to the Senate for consideration.

"The urgency [of the project] was approved, it has this regime and we can vote on the merits in the plenary in the Chamber. I believe that in the next few days, with the understanding of the government and all bodies, Central Bank, Revenue, Finance, the We can define a final report and vote on the project in the plenary so that it can go to the Senate in the first semester.‚Äù

The issue was controversially left out of the crypto law signed into law at the end of 2022. The Central Bank sought to find a way to incorporate such a rule into the regulatory framework it is currently drafting, but that has proven difficult. Ribeiro explained:

"We have been in dialogue with the Central Bank, we are working, but the process is more difficult due to the BC having a reduced staff. We are in this dialogue to have the agility to create the infra and put into practice what we approved and became law. It is fundamental for progress, providing the security that we so desire for the Brazilian market.‚Äù
