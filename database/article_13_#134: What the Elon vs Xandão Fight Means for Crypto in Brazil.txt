Welcome back to üáßüá∑Brazil Crypto Report for the week of April 1-5, 2024.

We had massive news over the weekend as Elon Musk publicly criticized Brazilian Supreme Court justice Alexandre de Mor√£es‚Äôs demands that the X/Twitter platform block certain Brazilian accounts deemed to be spreading misinformation.

Musk explained that X would not comply with Xand√£o‚Äôs demands, even if it means losing all revenue in the country and being kicked out of Brazil entirely. See Twitter Files thread by journalist Michael Shellenberger for context on how the whole ordeal began.

Mor√£es responded late Sunday night by ordering Musk to be investigated for obstruction of justice and incitement to crime, while threatening fines.

I won‚Äôt get into the politics of all this, but the likely outcome is that X/Twitter is going to be banned in the Brazil very soon. Musk‚Äôs pinned post is now instructing users to download a VPN app to continue using X. 

This will have a number of implications for the crypto world in Brazil. The first is that access to information about crypto will be severely constrained, as X/Twitter has been crypto‚Äôs town square for over a decade now. It is the primary platform where knowledge is exchanged and connections are made. There is already a crypto information gap between Brazil and the rest the of the world ‚Äî this would only serve to exacerbate that. 

One positive implication is that this battle creates more urgency for people to build and adopt decentralized social platforms on which to communicate, build brands and businesses, etc. 

The main driver of Web3 adoption, unfortunately, will be pain. In the event of an X blockage, there will be a lot of pain inflicted on Brazilian individuals and businesses (many who have nothing to do with politics) ‚Äî perhaps this will be the moment they begin to look for alternatives.

Buckle up because it looks like this will be a wild ride.

üéôNew podcast!

This week, I talk to Michael Casey about Argentina, its precarious macroeconomic situation and how the country has become a ground zero for crypto adoption. 

Michael lived in Argentina for six years during the 2000s as a financial markets correspondent for Wall Street Journal, where he covered a myriad of financial crises during that period. These experiences ultimately led him down the bitcoin rabbit hole. His understanding of Argentina‚Äôs history and recent struggles help to inform the conversation about current crypto adoption in the country.

Lula government aims to increase taxes on bitcoin holders

Finance Minster Fernando Haddad will submit a proposal to increase taxes on all cryptocurrency users to 22.5%, irrespective of whether the coins are held domestically or abroad. 

The proposal will be included in a broader bill that would overhaul taxes on financial investments. If approved, it would apply next year. 

Recall that Congress last year passed a 15% tax on cryptocurrencies held offshore, and that the Receita Federal recently released guidance explaining how this will apply. 

According to the bill, the government believes that these current rules will end up benefiting holders looking to circumvent income taxes.

Banco BV tests RWA tokens linked to auto financing

Banco BV is partnering with Parfin and CConsensus to issue RWA tokens linked to vehicle financing in Brazil. The tokens will ensure that the financing and transfer process can be done digitally via blockchain ‚Äî Hyperledger Fabric, in this case. 

The bank explained that some tests are already being performed in a test environment. 

Carlos Bonetti, Banco BV Risk and Operations Director, said in a statement: 

"The idea is that the bank conducts the entire financing operation, from simulation to discharge of the encumbrance and the completion of the vehicle's sale after the payment of the benefits by the buyer, which will provide greater agility and efficiency in the operation."

S√£o Paulo police request the arrest of Braiscompany CEO Antonio Neto Ais

S√£o Paulo Civil Police requested the preventative arrest of Neto Ais, the founder of the R$1 billion Braiscompany bitcoin pyramid scheme, and his wife Fabricia Campos. 

Both Neto and Campos have already been sentenced to 150 years in prison by the Federal Court of Paraiba.

Two other members of the scheme were also included in the request, which was sent to Campina Grande (where Braiscompany was headquartered) at the request of the SP Public Ministry. 

The couple was arrested by Interpol in Argentina last month after being on the run for more than a year. Both are awaiting extradition to Brazil.
