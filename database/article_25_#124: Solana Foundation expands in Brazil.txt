Have a great week everyone.

Receita Federal clarifies international crypto tax changes

The revenue service published guidance explaining how cryptocurrency holdings outside of the country will be taxed at a rate of 15 percent. Specifically, Brazilians will need to fill out a new form to declare all income arising from capital investments abroad. 

The document states:

"Financial investments made abroad directly by individuals continue to have their taxable income determined at each income realization event, using the cash basis, and are now taxed once a year, in the DAA. The rate is 15%.‚Äù

However, the Receita Federal stated that not all cryptocurrencies are subject to the law, and that further guidance on this matter will come at a later date. 

"Will all virtual assets be considered as financial investments abroad? No. Law No. 14,754, of 2023, refers to the regulation of the Special Secretariat of the Federal Revenue of Brazil the rules for classifying virtual assets as financial investments abroad."
