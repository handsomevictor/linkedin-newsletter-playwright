üáßüá∑BCR #85: Ethereum Rio recap; Binance's Nazar speaks out
Plus: CVM reopens investigation into Binance's derivatives offerings

Ol√° pessoal!

Welcome to üáßüá∑Brazil Crypto Report for the week of March 27-31, 2023! I just got back from a busy week at ETH Rio - it‚Äôs always great seeing old friends and meeting new ones at events like this.

Once the festivities had finished I snuck out to do some tourist essentials - a tour of the lagoons in Barra da Tijuca, Copacabana bike tour, a trip up the Corcovado mountain to see the Christ the Redeemer statue. Highly recommended!

As always, thanks everyone for reading and I hope you have a great week!

Ethereum Rio 2023 highlights Brazil‚Äôs Web3 momentum

ETH Rio 2023 did not have the same sizzle as the 2022 version, when CZ and his entourage showed up along with Rio mayor Eduardo Paes at the Museu da Amanha.

This year‚Äôs scaled back event took place with the price of ETH down 43% from last year, and CZ had more important things to deal with this time around (more on that later).

Located at the smaller but pleasant Museu de Arte across the street from last year‚Äôs venue, the event was laser-focused on builders and supporting the local community with a more inclusive vibe. Much more emphasis on technical talks and workshops, more Portuguese language content, more speakers from the local community and fewer ringers from abroad, etc.

In all, it was less craziness than last year but a tremendously important milestone for the Brazil Web3 ecosystem to continue building momentum in the midst of an extremely challenging bear market. The event was followed up by the ETHSamba conference and hackathon to create a full week‚Äôs worth of Web3 programming around town.

I had the honor of moderating a panel on blockchain gaming on the first day of ETH Rio with Helo Passos üéÆüåé, Rai Auad and Ant√¥nio Fonseca (thanks to Fernando Martines from Portal do Bitcoin for the write up!)

CVM reopens lawsuit against Binance

The Brazilian securities regulator reopened a case against B Fintech, a company that has partnered with Binance in Brazil, for allegedly illegally offering derivatives and acting as an intermediary for securities trading in the country since 2019.

The agency told InfoMoney that the ‚Äúemergence of new facts led to the reopening of the process.‚Äù While the CVM did not divulge specifically what those facts were, Binance‚Äôs rivals in the country consistently point out that Brazilian users are able to trade derivatives through the platform‚Äôs international website simply by changing the language from Brazilian Portuguese to Portuguese from Portugal.

The CVM targeted Binance for the same reason in 2020, ultimately issuing a stop order, but the case was suspended after the exchange agreed to cease offering the products in question.

The case was re-opened in December of last year after these new facts emerged.

Binance denied wrongdoing in a statement:

‚ÄúBinance reiterates that it does not offer derivatives in Brazil, that it operates in compliance with the local regulatory scenario and maintains a permanent dialogue with the authorities for the development of the crypto and blockchain segment in Brazil and in the world.‚Äù

Isac Costa, a partner at Warde Advogados and professor at @Insper and Ibmec, told Valor that even with an incoming regulatory regime for crypto any derivatives trading in Brazil must occur on an authorized and regulated platform, which is the B3 exchange in Brazil.

‚ÄúThe mere hiring of a legal representative in the country or the purchase of a brokerage firm (in the case of Binance involving Sim;paul) would not be sufficient for the derivatives offer to be regulated, since the environment in which they are traded would also need authorization from the CVM as an organized market.‚Äù
Bigger Picture

The CVM‚Äôs action came the same week that US authorities charged Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao with illegally operating a digital asset derivatives exchange. Specifically, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission alleged that Binance deliberately aided American customers in circumventing US compliance requirements, such as by encouraging the use of VPNs to bypass geolocation restrictions.

Given the regulatory actions we‚Äôve seen coming from the US in recent months, it‚Äôs difficult to argue that there was not at least some coordination going on here between US and Brazil financial regulators.

Regulators globally appear to be launching a coordinated, full-throttled offensive against Binance and CZ. With Binance consolidating market share around the world after the FTX collapse, its seaworthiness is a critical variable that will determine the fate of this industry over the next 12-18 months.

Binance‚Äôs Nazar speaks

It‚Äôs worth checking out @Binance Brazil country manager Guilherme Nazar‚Äôs recent interview with BlockNews‚Äôs Claudia Mancini here. He notes that Brazil is already one of the five largest markets for Binance‚Äôs debit card product. Nazar also revealed that Binance will soon launch an NFT for the Brasileir√£o football tournament.

Nazar also responded to claims that Binance was behind the asset segregation provision being removed from the crypto law that passed last December. He argued that Binance is not necessarily against asset segregation but that it is trying to address the question of how to do it properly.

Nazar also gave an interview to Exame in which he brushed aside concerns that the Digital Real might crowd players like Binance out from the market, noting that CBDCs and cryptos can ‚Äúcoexist‚Äù.

"The market is large, the usability is many, will be many, and will multiply more and more. I think it can live together."
