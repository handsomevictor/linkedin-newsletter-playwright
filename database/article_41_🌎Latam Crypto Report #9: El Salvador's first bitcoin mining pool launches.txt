El Salvador’s first bitcoin mining pool launches

Volcano Energy and Luxor Technology have joined forces to create El Salvador’s first bitcoin mining pool.

The mining pool, called Lava Pool, will be powered with geothermal energy.
Volcano Energy, a public-private partnership, will exclusively mine bitcoin through Lava Pool, The Block reported. It will provide 23% of its net income to the El Salvador government, the news outlet added, citing a statement.

Chainalysis: Brazil, Argentina and Mexico lead Latam crypto adoption

Brazil, Argentina and Mexico placed in the top 20 on Chainalysis' 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index, with Brazil coming in 9th, Argentina in 15th and Mexico in 16th. The index is part of the blockchain analytics firm’s annual Geography of Cryptocurreny Report, which will be released in full later this year.

While we wait for that, we got an interesting preview looking into crypto usage in Latam, and Argentina and Venezuela in particular.

Some highights:

Latin America has, received 7.3% of the world’s crypto between July 2022 and June 2023.
Latam users exhibited a high preference for centralized exchanges compared to the global average. For example, these exchanges account for 92.5% of crypto activity in Venezuela. Mexico is a notable exception here as it has higher demand for altcoins that can only be traded on DEXs.

The dominance of stablecoins in the region continues to grow, particularly in the area of remittances. Bitso CEO Daniel Vogel says that his company processed US$3.3 billion in remittances flows into Mexico in 2022, this makes up roughly five percent of the country’s estimated total flow of US$61 billion.

Crypto purchases in Argentina ramped up significantly in the last year due to hyperinflation and the plummeting value of the Argentine Peso. The chart below shows the increase in purchase volume compared to decline value of the peso since November 2022.

Alfonso Martel Seward, head of compliance at Lemon (which has more than 2 million users in Argentina) explained:

“We have really high inflation, and there are lots of restrictions against buying foreign currencies. That makes crypto a valuable option for saving…As crypto adoption has grown, lots of people here will now get their paycheck and immediately put it into USDT or USDC.”

A similar trend has was observed in Venezuela as residents grapple with extreme hyperinflation and political instability.

This Chainalysis report is the gold standard when it comes to quantifying crypto adoption globally, so we’ll revisit this once the full report and datasets are published. We’ll also try to get a podcast interview with the Chainalysis research team to discuss these findings more in depth.

Buenos Aires to use ZK proofs for digital identity

Buenos Aires is launching a “decentralized digital identity protocol” based on zero-knowledge proofs, CoinDesk and other outlets reported.

The city’s government is using an application based on Matter Labs’ zkSync Era rollup, CoinDesk said.
Buenos Aires residents will be able to use QuarkID wallets to start accessing digital identity documents such as birth and marriage certificates as soon as this month, zkSync said in a post. The QuarkID protocol is developed by Extrimian.

“This is a monumental step towards a safer and more efficient future for government services in Latin America,” Extrimian CEO Guillermo Villanueva said in statement. “QuarkID creates a closer relationship between a government and its citizens while also bringing digital identity practices and security standards to Latin America.”
