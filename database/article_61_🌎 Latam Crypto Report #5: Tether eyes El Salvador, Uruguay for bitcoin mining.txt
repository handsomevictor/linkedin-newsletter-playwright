¡Hola a todos! 👋

Welcome to the latest edition of the 🌎Latam Crypto Report.

I’m Kristin Majcher, a freelance journalist based in Bogotá, Colombia. This is the 🌎Latam Crypto Report, a sister newsletter to Aaron Stanley’s 🇧🇷Brazil Crypto Report 

Feel free to follow me on Twitter and LinkedIn and send over any Latin American crypto news stories we should be covering.

This week, we’ll dive into a Ripple partnership with Colombia’s central bank, Tether’s bitcoin mining ambitions in Uruguay and a new bitcoin mining project in El Salvador.

Ripple partners with Colombia’s Central Bank

Ripple is partnering with Banco de la República - Colombia (Colombia’s Central Bank) to “explore blockchain technology use cases” as the country develops its payment system. Blockchain technology firm Peersyst Technology will also participate in the project.

The pilot project, along with Colombia’s Central Bank and Ministry of Information and Communications Technologies (MinTIC), will use Ripple’s CBDC platform based on the XRP Ledger blockchain. The project will run until the end of the year.

As James Wallis, Ripple’s VP of Central Bank Engagements and CBDCs stated:

“By harnessing the power of the Ripple CBDC Platform based upon the XRPL, this project will pave the way for transformative advancements in the utilization of blockchain technology within the public sector.”

Colombia announced last year that it would consider developing a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), with the dual goal of easing transactions and curbing tax evasion.

Tether to launch Uruguay mining operation

Tether.io plans to get into bitcoin mining, with hopes to launch an operation in Uruguay before the year’s end. In a statement, the stablecoin issuer said it would be working with a local, licensed company on the initiative and will invest in renewable energy sources to make it happen.

Tether plans to hire energy experts in Uruguay to staff the operation, Blockworks pointed out, posting open positions on a new website for its so-called Tether Energy business.

Tether’s Chief Technology Officer Paolo A. said:

"By harnessing the power of Bitcoin and Uruguay's renewable energy capabilities, Tether is leading the way in sustainable and responsible Bitcoin mining.”

Volcano Energy sources $1b in commitments for El Salvador bitcoin mine

Another mining project in the region is in the works, and CoinDesk reported that Tether is investing in this one, too. Volcano Energy announced it has sourced $1 billion in commitments to start up a 241 megawatt (MW) bitcoin mine in El Salvador. The site will be powered with wind and solar energy.

The investments include a $250 million investment from “key bitcoin industry leaders.” El Salvador’s government will have a “preferred participation equivalent to 23% of the revenues.”
