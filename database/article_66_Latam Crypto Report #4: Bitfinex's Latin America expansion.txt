Bitfinex is looking to expand its presence in Latin America by partnering with Chilean crypto exchange Orionx for an undisclosed investment amount.

Orionx seeks to expand in Peru, Colombia and Mexico and reach more than 1 million users by 2024, Bitfinex stated in a press release.
Orionx, founded in 2017, offers a crypto exchange, plus additional services including a wallet and instant crypto sales and purchases.
Bitfinex recently received a digital asset license in El Salvador last month — the first ever to be issued in the country.

Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino said:

“We’re excited to collaborate with Orionx as we look to expand our presence in Chile and across Latin America.” “This represents a major step forward in our efforts to harness the power of Bitcoin and decentralized technology to promote financial freedom and empower businesses that share our values. We look forward to working even more closely with the team at Orionx to support its growth and development going forward.”

Latin American users sent estimated $3.6 million in crypto to China-based shops for fentanyl production: Chainalysis

A fascinating new report by Chainalysis reveals crypto’s role in the global fentanyl market, which heavily depends on Latin America for the production and eventual transport of the deadly drug to U.S. buyers.

As the Chainalysis report explains:

According to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)’s report, the most common flow of fentanyl involves the movement of chemicals from China to Latin America, after which Mexican drug cartels package the chemicals into fentanyl products and smuggle them into the United States.

Chainalysis estimates that China-based companies selling precursor chemicals related to fentanyl have received more than $37.8 million in crypto through associated addresses, with Latin America, North America, Europe and Asia having a “high degree of exposure” to these suspected addresses.
Latin America-based crypto addresses have sent an estimated $3.6 million in crypto to chemical shops in China, according to Chainalysis’ methodology.
