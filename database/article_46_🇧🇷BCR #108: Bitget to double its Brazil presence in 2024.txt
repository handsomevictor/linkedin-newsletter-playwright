🇧🇷BCR #108: Bitget to double its Brazil presence in 2024
Plus: Bradesco, Caixa, Banco do Brasil execute first Drex transfers; Mercado Bitcoin launches its Drex node

Olá pessoal!

Welcome to 🇧🇷Brazil Crypto Report for September 4-8, 2023! 

Last week was relatively slow on the news front due to the holiday (September 7 is Brazil’s Independence Day). We did, however, have a few important developments with Drex, the wholesale CBDC being developed by the Central Bank. 

I’ll be at Blockchain Rio this week doing some speaking, recording and hanging out/meeting people. If you’ll be on the ground and want to meet up, feel free to shoot me a note - @AaronStanley on Telegram or aaron@brazilcrypto.report 

Thanks for reading and have a great week everyone!

🎧 For this week’s podcast interview, Antonio Neto and I were joined by Maria Gabriela Damiani, technical advisor at the CVM.

Bradesco, Caixa and and Banco Inter execute Drex test transfer

Banco Bradesco executed a successful interbank transfer with CAIXA omica and Banco Inter using Drex/Digital Real testnet tokens. 

The transaction involved tokenized bank reserves, similar to the ones executed last month by BTG Pactual and Itaú Unibanco, and Banco do Brasil and Caixa. Next, Inter intends to simulate a transfer of tokenized reais from an Inter client to a Caixa client as soon as it obtains necessary approval from the Banco Central do Brasil.

Bruno Grossi, MSc, technology manager at Banco Inter, said that the Hyperledger Besu network chosen for the pilot has been largely functioning well. 

““Transactions are taking place within 3 to 5 seconds without any delay…communication has been transparent and open with everyone. We are talking a lot with Caixa because of Microsoft, which is in both our consortium and Caixa's.”

Mercado Bitcoin consortium launches Drex node

The Drex pilot consortium led by Mercado Bitcoin successfully launched its node on the platform after resolving bandwidth limitations (addressed in last week’s newsletter) that have been making it difficult or participants to connect to the Central Bank’s network. 

The consortium includes 万事达卡, CERC and Sinqia - a fintech that uses Banco Genial’s infrastructure to integrate with the Central Bank

The group also opted to create its own Hyperledger Besu network to test out new features that can eventually be deployed on mainnet. Genial explained in a blog post: 

"To optimize development, the group chose to create its own Hyperledger Besu network, enabling the development of features that will be applied to the Central Bank pilot."

Bitget looks to double its presence in Brazil over next 12 months

Seychelles-based crypto exchange Bitget is making gains in the Brazil and Latam markets following the demise of FTX. The exchange currently operates in 100 countries with 20 million users, and is 11th largest broker globally and the fifth largest platform for crypto derivatives. 

In an interview with Valor, managing director Gracy Chen said that Bitget arrived in the region in early 2022 and now has 200 employees in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico. 

“Brazil is one of the most prominent markets for Bitget. The country showed growth of 160% in the number of active users and 180% in business volume in the first half of the year. Bitget plans to double the numbers for Brazil and Latin America by the first half of 2024.”

In a separate interview with Exame’s João Pedro Malar Massa, Thomson Ma, Bitget’s director of operations in Latin America, explained that Brazil has emerged as “one of the most prominent markets for Bitget” and that the exchange is aiming to double its numbers and presence in the country over the next 12 months. He said: 

“The Latin American region has been gaining successive prominence in our business, and Brazil is strategic for us, one of our fastest growing markets in the world. The first half of 2023 was very strong, especially if we consider the effects that FTX's bankruptcy brought to our sector. The number of active users jumped 110% and trading volume increased 60% in the country compared to December 2022.”
Brazil is ideally-positioned to be a crypto hub, says Hashdex CIO 

In a series of interviews this week, Hashdex CIO Samir Kerbage argued that Brazil is well-setup to be a hub for crypto innovation given the advancements the market has seen in the last 12 months and the uncertainty in the US.

““We passed the first barrier in Brazil, which was regulatory clarity…We had the legal framework for cryptoassets and the new CVM [Brazilian SEC] regulation, which placed cryptoassets as a financial asset. Now we are in the phase of the Central Bank making its regulations.”

This clarity in a see of uncertainty in the US and elsewhere has prompted an influx of capital into the country, he argued:

“We see capital coming here because of this. We see venture capital coming to invest in Brazilian companies, and foreign companies coming to Brazil to offer this service here, because this is where the market is developing.”

Kerbage also gave some market commentary in a separate interview with InfoMoney, arguing that the fundamentals for bitcoin price appreciation in the coming year appear strong:

“We are very optimistic about 2024 and 2025, due to the combination of secular and cyclical technology factors”
