Ol√° pessoal!

Welcome back to Brazil Crypto Report for the week of May 20-24, 2024! I‚Äôm on my way to Consensus in Austin. Hope to see some of you there this week!

I‚Äôll be hanging around the Filecoin booth during the main event, moderating a session at the DeAI Day side event on the 30th (which is being hosted by Erik Voorhees‚Äô new Venice.AI project), and co-hosting the ACJR meetup on the 29th ahead of the Coin Center dinner.

BCR is also a community partner for the Latinos in Web3 Meetup on Friday, May 31, which is being hosted by Christian Narvaez and the Web3Familia team.

In other news, I had the honor of participating in the Modular House Brasilia event this past Saturday, hosted by the awesome Modular Crypto team. They‚Äôre doing a roadshow around Brazil the rest of the year hosting these meetups in different cities so definitely worth checking one out and supporting them!

üîçWhat‚Äôs in this week‚Äôs BCR?

New podcast

This week‚Äôs episode is a conversation Web Summit Rio conversation I had with Yat Siu , co-founder and executive chairman of Animoca Brands .

Privacy roadblock remains as 1st stage of Drex pilot concludes

The Banco Central do Brasil hosted its fourth Drex Forum event last Wednesday, during which it announced that it would incorporate a new stage into the Drex pilot focused on privacy solutions and new business cases.

The news is not a huge surprise given that the bank began signaling in April that it had hit an impasse on finding an adequate privacy solution that satisfies both technological and legal requirements.

Central Bank official Rog√©rio Lucca explained that the maturity of existing data privacy solutions ‚Äúdoes not yet allow us to safely produce a platform at this time.‚Äù The bank further affirmed that no testing involving the broader population will be performed until a solution to this problem is found.

The first phase of the pilot will wrap up in the coming months, followed by a comprehensive report on the findings. The second phase is expected to commence in July and will run into the first half of 2025.

Recall that the original timeline was for testing to conclude in May 2024, followed by a gradual rollout to the public.

What to expect in the second stage

The second phase of the Drex pilot will broaden the search for privacy solutions as well as the types of assets, smart contracts and business cases that can be deployed on the platform.

Drex coordinator Fabio Araujo explained that once the first phase concludes the bank will put forth a call for new pilot participants to evaluate and build new use cases on the platform:

‚ÄúThe intention is to bring other types of assets onto the platform and in this way it is necessary for us to bring the regulators of these assets‚Äù.

These new use cases could include, but are obviously not limited to, vehicle registrations, CDBs and real estate. Until now, Drex has focused on a limited range of use cases such as tokenized federal bonds and the development of tokenized currency for use by both financial institutions and retail.

Expanded system governance will also be a priority for the second phase. Once a new governance standard has been defined, the Drex pilot will be opened up to new participants, Araujo said. The application window for new participants should be opened during the third quarter of 2024.

Privacy is key

But the main focus of the second phase will be continued privacy testing related to these use cases.

The bank also provided more detail on how the solutions currently in play have been tested:

Anonymous Zether was tested in the context of digital real transfer flows and the purchase and sale of public bonds
EY‚Äôs Starlight was used to test the purchase and sale of public securities
Parfin‚Äôs Rayls (formerly Parchain) was used to test all of the above flows

Clarissa de Souza, coordinator of the Drex project‚Äôs technology testing, revealed that the bank recently began testing Microsoft‚Äôs ZKP Nova solution:

‚ÄúMicrosoft has invested a lot in implementing this solution and the flows, so we are following the same process of validating the flows, the architecture, the solution, and then moving on to a testing phase with the participants if all these evaluations really demonstrate that it is a tool that is capable of being tested within the Drex pilot.‚Äù
Hard nut to crack

Why has the privacy problem been such a challenge? Parfin CEO Marcos Viriato explained to Valor that a series of multiple complex variables need to be met, such as the scalability of privacy and speed of transactions when they are ‚Äúhidden‚Äù:

‚ÄúHyperledger Besu block time is five seconds. If the solution can execute multiple transactions close to this time then it is performing reasonably.‚Äù

However, bank officials insist that the privacy roadblock is temporary and a challenge that will be solved. Rafael Bianchini Abreu Paiva , coordinator of financial risk regulation of financial market infrastructure at the Central Bank, explained at an event hosted by Zoop, per Valor:

"It is public, it has already been reported that what Drex got stuck on the issue of secrecy. Does that mean it is unfeasible? No. It is possible to think of solutions that guarantee bank secrecy ‚Äî the issue is that they take away scale, speed, increase the cost or they are private solutions, which could create problems down the road."

Bianchini reverted to the ‚Äúblockchain trilemma‚Äù which argues that it is impossible to have scalability, security and decentralization:

"The blockchain is extremely secure and decentralized, but it is not scalable. Pix has already had a peak of 2 thousand transactions per second and can handle more than 5 thousand. The blockchain had a peak of 15 transactions per second. While a transaction on Pix takes 1 second. Secondly, on the blockchain it takes an average of 10 minutes.".

While the tokenization elements are functional and a privacy solution seems likely to be found, the delays mean that trying to estimate an exact launch date at this stage is futile.

Mateus Casanova Pereira , head of products and IT at UNICRED (a participant in one of 16 consortia currently operating in the Drex pilot) told Valor:

‚ÄúThere is no way to predict when it will be available to the population. It is not possible to say that we will be with Drex in 2025, it could be until 2026‚Äù

Casanova went on to argue that Drex will likely be phased in gradually for use by the general population, whereby use cases can be tested out individually.

‚ÄúWe can tokenize practically anything. The important thing is to have a reason behind it.‚Äù

Brazil imported US$1.7 billion of crypto in April, up 2x YoY

The value of cryptocurrency imports into Brazil totaled US$1.7 billion in April 2024 ‚Äî double the US$763 million amount recorded in the prior year period.

The figure was down slightly from US$1.8 billion in March, and does not separate out stablecoins from assets like bitcoin or ethereum.

Fernando Rocha, head of the statistics department at the Central Bank of Brazil, explained to Valor that adoption of these assets is growing as people gain more knowledge about the topic:

‚ÄúAlthough crypto assets are not exactly new, I would still say that they are gaining market share, it is still something that started not so long ago.‚Äù

Central Bank outlines regulatory next steps

The Central Bank released the next three phases of its ongoing project to regulate crypto assets though what it calls ‚Äúinfralegal regulation.

The goal is to finalize regulatory proposals by year‚Äôs end and then implement them in 2025.

The first phase will be a second public consultation in the second half of the year ‚Äî whereby the bank puts forth its proposals to the market and public for input. This consultation cycle will focus on establishing general standards for service providers in the crypto sector and an authorization model for their operations.

The second phase deals with the regulation of stablecoins, "especially in the spheres of competence of the Central Bank regarding payments and the foreign exchange market".

The third phase consists of a regulatory framework for virtual asset service providers in the country that seek to provide direct offering, intermediation and custody of crypto assets.

Nagel Lis√¢nias Paulino , an official in the bank‚Äôs financial system regulation department, said in a statement:

‚ÄúThe regulation aims to offer minimum requirements for virtual asset service providers to carry out their activities, also dedicating themselves to providing adequate practices when dealing with their customers. The idea is to evolve in the construction of normative acts that will deal with virtual asset service providers, including business and authorization aspects.‚Äù
