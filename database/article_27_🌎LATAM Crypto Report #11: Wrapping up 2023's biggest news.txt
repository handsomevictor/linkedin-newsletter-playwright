Top 10 Latam Crypto Stories of 2023

We know best-of lists tend to be overplayed this time of year. But since we’ve put together 10 previous editions of the LCR we couldn’t help but assemble the biggest news highlights all in one place.

Here are 10 key crypto moments from 2023, each chosen from one edition of the LCR and listed in chronological order.

LCR#1: Latin American startups feel collapse of crypto-friendly banks

When we launched our first edition of the LCR, the hot topic was the collapse of tech-focused Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and crypto-friendly banks Silvergate Bank and Signature Bank. SVB in particular was one of the few US-based banks willing to work with founders and startups in the region.

Latitud founder Brian Requarth told Reuters at the time:

"This touched (almost all) venture-backed companies in Latin America.”

Thiago Cesar , then the CEO of Transfero Group, explained the impact on crypto brokers:

“Most crypto exchanges lost their U.S. dollar rails.[...] It impacted the alternative FX market in LATAM fueled by crypto.”

LCR#2: El Salvador Grants Bitfinex Securities a Digital Asset License

In April, El Salvador finally granted Bitfinex Securities a digital asset license to issue tokenized assets through its exchange based there.

The license is a key step in making El Salvador’s so-called bitcoin-backed “Volcano Bonds” a reality.

LCR#3: Argentina’s central bank restricts crypto for fintechs

Argentina’s central bank doubled down on its stance that financial institutions can’t offer crypto services in May, issuing a statement saying that payment service providers were prohibited from offering services with unregulated currencies like digital assets. This impacted popular platforms like Ualá, Bind Pagos, MercadoPago, Personal Pay, Mobbex, Nubi, Modo and Pomelo.

The notice came almost exactly a year after it told financial institutions that they could not offer crypto services. We’ll be anxiously waiting to see if this regulation survives Milei’s motosierra in 2024. (LCR#3, May 5)

LCR#4: Latin American users sent estimated $3.6 million in crypto to China-based shops for fentanyl production: Chainalysis

The fight against fentanyl trafficking was one of the biggest news stories of 2023, and a Chainalysis investigation highlighted crypto’s role. Latin America proved to be a nexus for this activity, as crypto addresses in the region sent nearly $3.6 million in crypto to chemical shops in China. (LCR#4, May 26)

LCR#5: Volcano Energy sources $1b in commitments for El Salvador bitcoin mine

One of 2023’s most interesting stories was that Tether plans to spend about $500 million in the next few months to enter the world of crypto mining. While Bloomberg reported that number in November, we caught some hints about the company’s ambitious plans earlier in the year. In late May, Blockworks reported that Tether was eyeing Uruguay to launch a mining operation, and CoinDesk reported that the company was also investing in a new bitcoin mining site in El Salvador. The public-private partnership behind the site, Volcano Energy, announced it sourced $1 billion in commitments for a 241 megawatt (MW) bitcoin mine powered by wind and solar energy. (LCR#5, June 21)

LCR#6: Binance axes Argentine Football Association sponsorship

Binance ended a five-year partnership with the Argentine Football Association (AFA) after just a year, CoinDesk reported. The crypto company claimed the soccer organization had breached its contract, though the breakup occurred in the leadup to Binance’s US$4.3 billion settlement with authorities - a time when certain partners were distancing themselves from the exchange. LCR#6, July 19)

LCR#7: Argentina investigates Worldcoin

As the Worldcoin project made its way around the Southern Cone to register users by scanning their eyeballs, Argentina’s Agency for Access to Public Information (AAIP) announced that it had started an investigation. “The investigation will carefully analyze the processes and practices in relation to the collection, storage and use of personal data,” the AAIP noted. (LCR#7, August 15)

LCR#8: Binance says goodbye to Mastercard partnership, launches remittance service

Several news outlets reported that Binance and Mastercard would be ending their crypto card partnership on September 22, affecting cardholders in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Bahrain.

(LCR#8, September 5)

LCR#9: Chainalysis: Brazil, Argentina and Mexico lead Latam crypto adoption

Chainalysis revealed that Brazil, Argentina and Mexico placed in the top 20 on the company’s 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index. Brazil came in 9th, Argentina in 15th and Mexico in 16th place. For more context about this incredible Chainalysis report, check out Aaron’s interview with research director Kimberly Grauer👇. (LCR#9, October 14)

LCR#10: Crypto-friendly, libertarian Javier Milei to become Argentina’s next president

Capping off an exciting year of news was crypto-friendly Javier Milei’s surprise win during Argentina’s presidential elections. In our last version of LCR, we dug into Milei’s stance on crypto and the policies he hopes to implement. We plan to follow this story closely in 2024, and already have some breaking news on the topic to share below in our news roundup.

For more color on how what the Milei election means for Argentina’s crypto industry, you can check out Aaron’s interviews with Ripio CEO Sebastian Serrano no, Bitso Argentina CEO Julian Colombo and Bitcoin Argentina co-founder Daniel Rybnik. (LCR#10, November 22)
