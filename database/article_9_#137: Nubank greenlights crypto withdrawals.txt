Likely Campos Neto successor Galipolo casts shadow over Drex

Gabriel Muricca Gal√≠polo, Director of Monetary Policy and at the Banco Central do Brasil and likely successor to current bank president Roberto Campos Neto, called into doubt the bank‚Äôs innovation agenda and the future of the Drex project.

At the Upload Summit in S√£o Paulo on April 24, he described the bank‚Äôs innovation agenda as ‚Äúchallenging‚Äù and commented on the technical difficulties facing Drex:

"Not even the biggest companies in the world in the technology sector were able to offer [solutions] in a way that would be adequate."

Gal√≠polo is one of the names being floated to replace Campos Neto when his term expires at the end of 2024.

Citi: Brazil leads Latam in digital money adoption

A new report from Citi placed Brazil as the most advanced country in Latin America in terms of digital money ‚Äî taking into account government and private sector support, digital payment solutions and usage by the population.

Driss Temsamani, director of digital business for Citigroup in Latin America, told Valor:

‚ÄúThe Brazilian population adopts new technologies and is prepared for what is new.‚Äù

Brazil ranked ahead of Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Colombia in the report.

Campos Neto: Stablecoins, not cryptos, are growing in Brazil

The Central Bank president spoke about the growth in stablecoin adoption that he‚Äôs observed across the region and argued that this is much more common than usage of other crypto assets.

Speaking at an event hosted by Legend Capital in S√£o Paulo, he explained:

"What is growing is not cryptocurrencies, but what we call stablecoins. People are understanding that they are a cheap way to have an account in dollars because, of stablecoins, 99.9% are dollars. There are countries that you have a currency that is not convertible and people want to have an account in dollars. Today, if you want to have an account in dollars and you are Brazilian, you need to have a high volume of resources, but you can buy stablecoins and, in a certain way, you‚Äôve opened a digital dollar account.‚Äù

He also noted that confidence in ‚Äústable cryptocurrencies‚Äù suffers from a lack of assurance that the assets are properly backed:

"Research shows that people want to have an account in dollars, but they are also afraid of stablecoins, as they do not believe in the collateral, because they do not know if there is actually a dollar on the other side of the transaction. If you had a stablecoin with more transparency and segregation of accounts, I think it would grow much faster."
