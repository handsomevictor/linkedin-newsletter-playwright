#123: Crypto ETFs in Brazil are top performers for 2023
Plus: All eyes on Hashdex as possible US bitcoin ETF approvals loom in January

Ol√° pessoal!

Welcome to what is most likely the final edition of üáßüá∑Brazil Crypto Report for 2023, where we cover December 18-22.

This has been an incredible year for the digital asset ecosystem in Brazil and for BCR specifically, so big thanks to everyone who has supported this project in some capacity.

2024 figures to kick off a bang as we‚Äôve got probable ETF approvals in the US coming the first or second week of January. Everything up to this point has all been just the pre-game warmups - the real action is about to start so I hope everyone is ready to rock next year.

I hope everyone has a safe and happy Christmas and holiday season, and we‚Äôll talk again in 2024.
