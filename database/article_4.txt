Bancolombia launches new crypto exchange

Bancolombia, Colombia’s biggest bank, launched a crypto exchange through its subsidiary Wenia earlier this month.

The bank has shown interest in crypto for years, and launched a pilot project with Gemini in 2021 as part of Colombia’s regulated sandbox. Now, it is offering its own crypto exchange for Colombians through its subsidiary Wenia, a separate company licensed in Bermuda.

As Bancolombia Group President Juan Carlos Mora stated:

“As an organization, we have been working for almost a decade on the opportunity to create solutions that facilitate the adoption and use of digital assets and blockchain technology. As a result of this, we responded quickly to the adoption of Bitcoin in El Salvador.”

Bancolombia is launching Wenia with digital asset infrastructure provider AlphaPoint.
Wenia is separate company from Bancolombia, but a subsidiary of the same parent group. It “operates under a Class F license granted by the Bermuda Monetary Authority,” AlphaPoint said in a press release.
Wenia’s website says users will be able to trade digital assets including bitcoin, ether, Polygon’s Matic, USD Coin (USDC) and a new Colombian peso stablecoin CopW (Colombian Peso Wrapped) that operates on the Polygon network.
Wenia hopes to sign up more than 60,000 users in its first year of operations, according to a post on Bancolombia’s website about the news.

El Salvador introduces proof-of-reserves website
source:

More than two years after making bitcoin legal tender, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Office has launched a proof-of-reserves website showing how much of the digital currency the government holds at any given time and the transactions its treasury makes.

The announcement is especially significant considering that El Salvador recently revealed it had more bitcoin than previously thought, and the exact amount of its bitcoin holdings had been unclear. At the time of this report, El Salvador held 5,758.76 BTC worth nearly $400 million.

Venezuela bans crypto mining over energy grid concerns

In a developing story, Venezuela’s government said it plans to disconnect all crypto mining farms from the power grid over electricity concerns. The news comes after authorities seized more than 2,300 mining machines, local outlet Últimas Noticias reported. Meanwhile, crypto is playing a leading role in an ongoing corruption case involving Venezuela’s state oil company.

Venezuela said it plans to disconnect all crypto mining farms in the country from the power grid to avoid high electricity usage, Voice of America (VOA) reported.
Venezuela’s power ministry on social media announced it would be disconnecting crypto mining farms.
Non-governmental crypto association Asonacrip encouraged people and companies with installed crypto mining equipment to disconnect and store it. “We do not consider that this has a solution in the medium or short term,” it said in a Spanish-language X post.
