## Comment

- It's a random script for the use of the company I am working for, and it's NOT a good practice for web scraping.

## Aim

- Use playwright to get the newsletters content from LinkedIn.

## How to run

- Try run: [sync_version_linkedin_login.py](sync_version_linkedin_login.py)
(second one only if you have an account: remember to update in environment variables: LINKEDIN_USERNAME, LINKEDIN_PWD).
